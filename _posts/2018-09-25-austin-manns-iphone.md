[Austin Mann's iPhone Xs camera review 🔗](http://austinmann.com/trek/iphone-xs-camera-review-zanzibar) 
Surprise Austin takes great pictures with an iPhone again. This weekend I took a photo of a friend on sunny day when he was standing in the shade and it was hot. I suggested moving into the sun for a better picture, but he declined. Smart HDR would have lead to a much better end result. Then there was another moment at home where I suspect Smart HDR would have helped.  

This is really making me want a new iPhone.
