Here's a quick list of newsletters that are worth the time to read (this is just opinion, your mileage may vary) 

1. [Macstories](https://club.macstories.net) (Apple and iPad geekery, costs money)
2. [CJ Chilvers](https://www.cjchilvers.com/subscribe) (the best from CJ's blog on creating, life and stuff)
3. [Paul Jarvis](https://pjrvs.com) (great entrepreneurial and creative advice from someone who does things "the wrong way" but it works)
4. [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com) (More creative insights and curiosities)
5. [Rohdesign Dispatch](http://rohdesign.com/newsletter/) (great design and sketchnoting tips from the master)

I may come back and add to this
