A dumb nonsensical behaviour from myself. I've wanted to sign up as a [@relayfm](https://micro.blog/relayfm) member for a couple of years but everytime I'm about to I hit a "paradox of choice" situation. I think I want to give to every show, but there are some shows I don't listen to so I think about choosing one show...but which one! If I could tick the shows I listen to I would (but that would be much harder to impliment). So I get caught in a mental loop and delay signing up. So today I (finally) signed up for "all the great shows".
