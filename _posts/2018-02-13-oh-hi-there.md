So after this week [Mac Power users podcast](https://www.relay.fm/mpu/417) I finally got round to signing up for Micro.Blog. I had been meaning to do so for a bit, especially after seeing people like [Zsolt Benke at decoding](http://decoding.io/) using the service on their own site. However I wondered if I should use it on my own site or whatever. In the end, I signed up for a Micro.blog blog as I wanted to help support the service as well. Paying $5 seems like a good way to do so and solved my overthinking. 

So why did I sign up in the first place. 

## My increasing announance at Social Media (twitter)
I’ve increasingly felt that social media is very “meh”. I hate what Facebook has become as it increasingly tried to grab my attention with cheap tricks and tracks everything I do (no matter if I try to stop that). Twitter too isn’t perfect with its lack of efforts to stop trolling and abuse. 

## My annoyance at blogging 
Likewise I’m fed up of the “professional blogging culture”. There are so many “have tos” with blogging now like:  
- write long posts
- have links
- be helpful
- only show the good sides
- no link posts
- be on a single focus topic
And so on and so on. 
All great advice if you want to make money, but as [CJ Chilvers says](https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/welcome-back-blogging)

> “one is a business model, one is a life model” 

That’s what I’m hoping for in this site. Somewhere to play, somewhere to create and somewhere to be unprofessional.
