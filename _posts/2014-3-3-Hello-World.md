So I finally managed to get Jekyll set up on github pages using just an iPad. No Remote Desktop login with screens or SSH, only an iPad and working copy. Now, this was largely due to the great stuff by Barry Clark and ["Jekyll now"](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) a simple way to set up Jekyll remotely. I had spent some time trying to do the same thing without using Jekyll now but I couldn’t work out how. I’d love to know if there is a way to do this. 
Anyway, I have no idea if I’ll keep this site running or if this will be a test. Perhaps I’ll move a different site over to this one. Still, it’s fun to have such a simple blogging set up with editorial, markdown writing and working copy to push changes and posts.
