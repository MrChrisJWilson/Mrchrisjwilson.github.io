 Something I've been wondering about. Starbucks coffee size names. 

They are clearly influenced by Italian culture and attempt to communicate that but they are confusing so people just use large middle and small (in my experience). So it makes me wonder what could be a better system of names. Ones which reflect Italy but also are clear over the size. 
- Piccolo 
- Medio
- Grande
I don't think everyone would use them, but you wouldn't have to remember that Vente is in fact the largest coffee size, not the grand grande.
