I was updating my now page and thought it was a shame to delete the events from last month. So I’ve decided to write up a kind of “change log” at the start of each month reviewing the last month and highlighting what’s coming up this month. It’s a bit like a monthly review meets journal or whatever. 

## Then
My goals for last month were
- Spending time with my new baby (YES!)
- removing and stopping old projects (stopped many, but there are more I should probably stop!)
- experimenting with new calligraphy styles (definitely did)
- Finishing "the ninja project" (made some progress yesterday but didn’t do much previously)
- regular exercise (I got ill at the end of the month and with travel meant this was not a good month)

Some key events in the month were
- in-laws coming to visit, thrice
- Going to the International Sketchnote Camp in Lisbon
- iOS 12 came out with shortcuts.
- I returned to work from paternity leave. 

Unexpected delights
- Arbitrary stupid goal was a fun read
- [David Spark’s Siri Shortcuts](https://learn.macsparky.com/courses/) guide was useful
- On Writing Well has been a delight
- I got my company to pay for me to do the CopyBlogger Content Marketing Certification Course


## Now

This month my goals are
- Spend time with my daughter
- Continue the Copyblogger course (and not fall behind)
- Finish the “ninja project” (if possible)
- Finish reading On Writing Well
- Try some new Calligraphy styles
- Get writing portfolio finished
- Preparing for NaNoWriMo

## Upcoming Events 
- Parents visiting
- A close friend’s birthday
- A wedding 
- A new product launch
