- [A Walk Across America](http://www.amazon.com/dp/006095955X/?tag=minima0e-20) 

I started A Walk Across America (I heard about it via the [Sketchnote Army Podcast with Patrick Rhone](https://sketchnotearmy.com/blog/2018/8/27/sketchnote-army-podcast-season-05-episode-08-patrick-rhone)) and this line from the second chapter really struck me. I was reading the second before and had this gnawing feeling in my chest "Was the post-Vietnam US similar to today?" I can't answer this for certain, but lines like this make me wonder if there are some echoes in our world today.
