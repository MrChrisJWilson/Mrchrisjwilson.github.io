Well, it happened. A company I really like released a product that I have no interest in buying to the extent that I don’t even want to buy it to support them. I hope it sells well but it’s just not for me. I’ve seen this happen before and after that point every product a company made “wasn’t for me” so I’m really hoping this is a one off.
