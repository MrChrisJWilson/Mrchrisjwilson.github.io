This week I realised that I could add an about page to my Micro.Blog blog and it could be longer than the mini about desciption in my Micro.blog profile (thanks [@simonwood](https://micro.blog/simonwood)). As I was writing it, I did the classic thing that I've heard the folk at [The minimalists podcast](https://www.theminimalists.com/do/) complain about. **I used my job title to describe myself**. 

In facts, I used my job title as my **primary** description of myself. This is the natural and expected course of action. When we meet someone new, one of the first few questions is usually _"and what do you do?"_ which really means _"What's your job?" and potentially, "how much do you earn and are you worth my time". 

Well, the second part is the highly cynical take from the minimalists which I somewhat agree with. At the same time, if you do a 9-to-5 job, the chances are you spend 1/3 of your day doing that thing (then a further third sleeping) meaning you probably do spend most of your time doing your job.

My last job was a teacher, it's a pretty well respected thing to include in your profile. People generally think teachers are okay but not necessarily useful for themselves.

My new job is a title I really like, **"Content Writer"** which is a way to say _"copywriter but we pay you less"_ and it reflects a lot of what I like doing, researching and write. But in truth, it's not a full representation of my character and what I do. 

So I tried a different [About page](http://chrisjwilson.me/about/) here, one that focuses on actions and personality traits I want to exhibit first rather than where my paycheck comes from. I'm sure I'll revisit it and update it, but it's a start.
