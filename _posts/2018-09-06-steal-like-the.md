[Song Exploder - the Decemberists : once in my life](https://pca.st/episode/f0742c5d-ba50-4313-a2bf-ebe6271b3ade)

> As I was just playing it and playing it over and over again, it reminded me of one of these Yo La Tengo songs called "Barnaby hardly working" which is one of my favourite songs of all time. So we were playing it live and I felt moved one night to sing the last two lines of "Barnaby hardly working", "lays down by the river, face down by the river".

I loved this episode because it's such a great example of "stealing like an artist". Referencing the influences that lead to the song but how this diverse group of influences lead to a completely different song that doesn't sound like the influences at all.
