[No one makes a living on Patreon ](https://theoutline.com/post/2571/no-one-makes-a-living-on-patreon?zd=1&zi=mkw4iinv) 

>Of those creators, only 1,393 â€” 2 percent â€” make the equivalent of federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, or $1,160 a month, in October 2017. Worse, if we change it to $15 per hour, a minimum wage slowly being adopted by states, thatâ€™s only .8 percent of all creators. 

Kind of depressing reading as it casts a lot of doubt on pateron and donations as long term viable income streams. At the same time, it's not the _most_ suprising statistic and seems to refect common distribution curves where the top far out performs the majority.
