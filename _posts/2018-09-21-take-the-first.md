After a session at the [International Sketchnote camp in Lisbon](https://sketchnotecamp.wordpress.com) today I felt challenged and excited to share more of my sketchnoting online. It's something I've resisted doing because I don't feel I'm as good as others and I know that there are sometimes mistakes in my sketchnotes: crooked lines, spelling, running out of space. I was, however, reminded of the value of **sharing your work** as you go along and that, in reality, the process is what is really of value not the product. 

But how could I start? What step would be the easiest to get me to share more of my sketchnotes. 

The first step.

In my case, this would be **taking the photo of the sketchnote to share**. If I don't take the picture, I've got nothing to share. Once I've taken the photo then I've got something to share and it's fairly simple to type out a note and share the sketchnote from there. But taking the photo is a hanging point for me. I often don't take my phone out, and when it is I forget to/ resist take the photos. 

In fact, even if I don't share a sketchnote after photographing it, immediately or after a wait, I still have the sketchnote save and more available to share. 

I think this applied to many other areas. Just doing the first step can get the process going.
