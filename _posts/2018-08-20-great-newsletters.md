I've signed up to far too many newsletters in the past. Some have been great for a while and then warn thing and others weren't even that great at the start. Here are five which have stood my test of time (in no particular order) 
1. [Paul Jarvis](https://pjrvs.com) 
2. [Club Macstories](https://club.macstories.net) (paid)
3. [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/newsletter/) 
4. [Mike Rhode](http://rohdesign.com/newsletter/) 
5. [CJ Chilvers](https://www.cjchilvers.com/subscribe/) 

Share yours (you don't have to share five)
