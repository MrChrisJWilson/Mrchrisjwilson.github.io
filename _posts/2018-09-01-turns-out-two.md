Turns out two of my big complaints about DayOne V3 turn out not to be true. I **have** been grandfathered into my plus scheme _and_ you can now print books internationally. There are still aspects I miss about the original and I can see someone making a better rival, still I think Iâ€™ll stick with it for now.
