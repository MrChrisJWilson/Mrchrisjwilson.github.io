[Apple Music First Impressions - Benjamin Mayo](http://benjaminmayo.co.uk/apple-music-first-impressions)   

> The archaic concept of a standard album and a deluxe album are still in use. It’s a digitisation of a physical CD inventory, not a modern reset.

Ben's completely right here. It's a pain in Apple Music to go searching for certain music. The fact that singles get mixed in with Albums in a pain in the neck.
