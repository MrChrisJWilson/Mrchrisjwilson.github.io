[What makes a good blog?](http://www.43folders.com/2008/08/19/good-blogs)
> As I think about the blogs I've returned to over the years -- and the increasingly few new ones that really grab my attention -- I want to start with, ironically enough, a list. Here's what I think helps make for a good blog.
- Merlin Mann

I just discovered this thanks to [@ismh](https://micro.blog/ismh) 's [ten years of 512 pixels](https://512pixels.net/2018/09/10-years-of-512-pixels/) post and I'd say every bit of it still applies today. Both posts are worth reading.
