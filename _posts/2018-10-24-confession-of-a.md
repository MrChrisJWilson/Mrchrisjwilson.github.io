Six years ago, when I was living in Spain, I was obsessed by Productivity. I tried to make my system as efficient as possible, using the best apps to help me get things done and spending hours a week listening to podcast on the topic. 
Of course, the irony was that I spent more time learning to be more productive than actually being productive. It's easy to look down on that with hindsight as I now know many of the fundamental principles and ideas which help with productivity but back then I didn't. At the same time, I don't really care for listening about productivity advice (especially as an isolated topic) anymore, I know that the thing that would make the biggest difference for myself is applying what I already know, not learning something new. 

## The 20% that takes you 80% of the way
Just like everything, there are a few core productivity principles which take you a long way. Applying those will be more beneficial than spending hours trying to learn the other 80%. Unfortunately that means doing stuff rather than sitting back and listening or reading. I'm not certain on what this 20% is exactly  -- and it may well vary a bit for you -- but the things that make the biggest difference for me include:
- Getting a good nights sleep
- Doing some regular exercise 
- Not eating too much bad stuff (it makes me feel tired and bloated)
- Listing the key things I need to work on and do today
- Writing down the steps in a project and marking the next step
- If I don't know what the next step is, thinking of whom I could ask to find out
- Doing a task straight away if it will take 2 mins or less
- Saving tasks as soon as I can

## Perhaps I needed to be an addict?
I was originally going to write a bit of a rant against productivity culture where people constantly seek that extra trick (or worse app) that will help them _finally_ be productive (spoiler, no matter how productive you are, you can always be more productive and even if you do reach 100% productivity, you will still wish you could do more.) but as I started writing I realized I was (partially) wrong. Those earlier experienced actually help me greatly today and just because I don't need to hear that advice, doesn't mean others don't. 

Still, I wonder if most people who are concerned about being productivity would be better served spending more time **doing** than consuming about productivity.
