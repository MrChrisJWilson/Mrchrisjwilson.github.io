 [Inside J.R.R. Tolkien’s Notebooks, a Glimpse of the Master Philologist at Work](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/books/review/jrr-tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-elvish-language.html)
> Tolkien was the first philologist to establish such a network of evolving dialects that derive from one another “by slowly accumulating changes and divergences in form across time from a common ancestor species.”

I can't lie that this hits me in three directions. 
1. Tolkien
2. Languages
3. notebooks
I found it fascinating his work to include changes between dialects overtime. I've read a bit on the languages in Tolkein's world and the influences of real world languages on Elvish (particularly Welsh on Sindarin) but I hadn't paid attention to the evolution of these languages.
