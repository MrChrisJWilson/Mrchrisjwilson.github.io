So I’ve seen someone write and share an article that is surprisingly similar to one I wrote and only a day later. Mine was an “evergreen” topic but admittedly one that others have written about before. Chances are that this is just one of those strange coninsidences where **actually** we’re both being influenced by the same environment and so are getting the same sources of inspiration leading to similar/the same topic...But even as I write this, I realise this is actually the second time in just over a week. I’m not sure if this means I’m less original than I though...or someone’s copying my ideas? Either way, no one cares who has what idea, it’s the execution that matters.
