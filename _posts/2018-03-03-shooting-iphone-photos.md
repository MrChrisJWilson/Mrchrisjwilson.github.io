Yesterday I heard someone mention that their iPhone had shut down because it had got below zero Celsius (32 something Fahrenheit apparently). As someone who lives in a country where winter is often below zero (it's minus 7 celsius as I type), I know this pain. Generally I cope by putting my iPhone in my inner pocket so it is kept warm and relying on my apple watch or AirPods for interactions with the phone. But there's a huge issue when it comes to taking photos. 
I love photography and have far to many camera really, but there is something fun about the iPhone camera. I've been trying to use it more recently and play with its limits and strengths but the cold weather has put a stop to those plans. Literally. 
So today I was looking for some advice on how to shoot photos with your iPhone in winter…So far I haven't found any useful advice so I have an idea that _just might work._
## Hand Warmers
Yup, you know those little chemical hand warmers which you can “recharge" by heating them up again. In theory holding a small one next to the back of the iPhone while I have it out of my pocket should help to keep it warm _and_ should also help when it's in my pocket. 
Of course, other sides will be exposed to the elements but this is better than nothing. 

I'm going to give it a go and report back on my success/not but I wonder **Do you have any tips for keeping your iPhone alive in the cold?**
