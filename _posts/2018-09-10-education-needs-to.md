[Education needs to be inconvenient](https://seths.blog/2018/09/education-needs-to-be-inconvenient/)

> Education needs to be inconvenient because it relies on effort and discomfort to move us from where we were to where we want to be. The internet gives us more access than ever, and if we care enough, we can use that convenient access to explore the inconvenient places that we know we should be exploring. 

- Seth Godin
