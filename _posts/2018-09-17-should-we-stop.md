[Should We Stop Listening to Podcasts? — CJ Chilvers](https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/should-we-stop-listening-to-podcasts)

> When you mention time and attention theft, most creators think of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (which I call Facebook II). They usually don’t think about Youtube or podcasts, which have the same issues: the ad model and all its abuses to the listener, and the lack of quality in favor of burn-out-inducing “consistency” and quantity (something that is also tied to the ad model).

I recently cut the number of podcast I listen to for similar reasons. With exceptions, podcast tend towards entertainment over content. I don't think there is anything inherently wrong with that. **It's good to switch off and be entertained from time to time but not all the time.**
Still greater intentionality is always good, as is [protecting your attention](http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/09/09/protect-your-attention.html).
