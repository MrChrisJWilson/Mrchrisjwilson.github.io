> But I was opposed to becoming "mileage crazy". Mileage craziness is a serious condition that exists in many forms. It can hit unsuspecting travellers while driving cars, motorcycles, riding in planes, crossing the country on bicycles or on foot. The symptoms may lead to obsessively placing more importance  on how many miles are traveled than on the real reason for traveling.
