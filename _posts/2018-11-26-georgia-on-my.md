One of my new listening habits at work is to listen to a jazz classic performed by several different people. One of the best things about Jazz is how different performers interpret and add their own flare onto a standard version. YouTube is such a great place to find these variations. 

So here is a [playlist of variations of Georgia on my mind](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLykefMsqC1nda54r6js-w5tOFCc7YTCgd), some more jazzy, some more bluesy, many are solo guitar pieces but some have backing tracking or a band. 


P.s. I've made a [new page where I'll collect some of these lists.](http://chrisjwilson.me/jazz-standards/)
