[Evernote lost its CTO, CFO, CPO and HR head in the last month as it eyes another fundraise | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/evernote-lost-its-cto-cfo-cpo-and-hr-head-in-the-last-month-as-it-eyes-another-fundraise/)
> TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that in the last month, Evernote  lost several of its most senior executives, including its CTO Anirban Kundu, CFO Vincent Toolan, CPO Erik Wrobel and head of HR Michelle Wagner beyond the usual attrition of engineers and designers.

> The departures are coming at a key time: we have also heard that Evernote isÂ fundraising, potentially in a down-round from its most recent (but now several years-old) valuation of $1.2 billion.

Yikes! This is really not great news. I've used Evernote for years and been a paying member for the last three. It's not a perfect app/service, but it does the job and in the last year the company has really improved (aka, they stopped bugging me about workchat). Still, stuff like this suggests that things may not be so hot, I'd better look for an alternative and a way to move all my notes out.
