I collapsed on my bed at 2:30 on Wedneday morning after driving home from the hospital. I had been concerned that I wouldn't be able to fall a sleep but soon my heavy eyes shut for four hours or so till my morning alarm reopened them. 

Four hours earlier my baby girl left her hiding place and entered the world. It's an experience which was truly mind blowing and left me speechless and frozen. I'm not sure anything could have made me properly prepared though.

My daughter has entered a completely different world to the one I did just over thirty years ago. My wife and I were discussing it just the night before that she'll see incredible things and grow up in a world so removed from our own. She'll face new challenges (as well as some of the same old ones) and be blessed with new advantages. 

For the last few months I've known roughly when my daughter would arrive -- though she did decide to arrive early -- and with several commitments and invitations I've replied that I'd have to see how things are once she is here. This is continuing as she remains in Hospital. 

I'm fully prepared for all my once existent free time to disappear in a puff of smoke. It's certainly made me reevaluate many of the things I've been doing. Many of them just don't see important in the grand scheme of things now, others seem more fun. It's a big part of my change in writing and embracing micro.blog further as well as enjoying drawing and analogue tools more.

Regardless, my plans don’t focus that much on me anymore. I’ll be adapting to her needs and wants. 

I can't wait to learn more about her and what she's interested in.
