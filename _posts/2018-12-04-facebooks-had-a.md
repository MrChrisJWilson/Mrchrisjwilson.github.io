[Looking Back on Facebook's Murky 2018: Here's Why Users Are Sticking Around (New Data)ðŸ”—](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/facebook-2018-user-motivation)

>But with every new announcement and report, it seems that it isn't quite enough for people to part ways with the social network for good.

I don't really get value out it, certainly less than other places, and the value I do get out of it could be replaced by alternatives....and yet I'm still there.
