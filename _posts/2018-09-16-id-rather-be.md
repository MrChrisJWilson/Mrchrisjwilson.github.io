[Iâ€™d rather be a blogger](https://pjrvs.com/blogger/?mc_cid=aa65d786c3&mc_eid=d098183321)

> I just think one of the main reasons that the internet took off like it did from the lateâ€“90s onward was that people could finally have a voice, regardless of whether or not that voice drove clicks and views. No need to go through gatekeepers like print publications, book publishers, etcâ€¦ we could just write something and hit publish. Now our voices are collectively passed through the values of content marketing and growth-hacking.

I probably could have linked to Paul's whole article but what's the point in that. So instead I quoted the part I found most inspiring. It's a really great take on the difference between blogging and content marketing. This hit me hard as I've done a lot of "contentting" and not that much blogging until I came on Micro.blog...it's good to be blogging.
