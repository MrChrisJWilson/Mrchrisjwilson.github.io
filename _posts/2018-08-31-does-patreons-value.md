Patreon has always seemed like an interesting idea to me and I’ve backed a few groups for a couple of months at a time. For some reason I always stop. At the same time I back other site memberships. I imagine that I’d love to keep all the sites I’m a member of in one easier to manage location (patreon) and so I suspect the value of patreon for the backer increases the more things you back at the same time. Still, it’s not been enough to get me to back...yet.
