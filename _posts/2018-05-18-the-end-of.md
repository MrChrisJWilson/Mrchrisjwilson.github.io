[Daring Fireball: The End of Third-Party Twitter Clients?](https://daringfireball.net/2018/05/the_end_of_third_party_twitter_clients)

> This antipathy to third-party clients is especially confounding considering that Twitter recently dropped support for their own native Mac client. As far as Iâ€™m aware, once this comes to pass next month, there will be no way to receive notifications of Twitter DMs on a Mac. None. 

At moments like this I'm really glad for micro.blog
