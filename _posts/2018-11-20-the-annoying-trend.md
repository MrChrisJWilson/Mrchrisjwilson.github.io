One of the things that annoys me the most about the modern internet landscape is how much stuff is made about making stuff. Especially when it is the same form as the thing which is being made. 
- Blog posts about writing blog posts
- Youtube Videos about making YouTube videos
- Podcasts about podcasts (this is probably the least offender)
I now wonder if this is part of the inherit nature of being an indie creator. If you become successful and go full time, then the thing you are making becomes your full time job. What else can you write about...except writing about running your job. 

Of course, **it's not inevitable** and I think the **best** online content avoids this pitfall. CGP Grey's great videos aren't about how he makes his videos, Amanda Palmer's music isn't about making music and Andy Weir wrote a great book about a man on mars on his blog. 

My challenge to myself is to focus more on making things, and not making things about making things.
