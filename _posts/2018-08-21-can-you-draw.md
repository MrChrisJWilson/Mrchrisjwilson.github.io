Yesterday evening I suddenly had a random idea*, _could I draw a face with just vertical lines?_ I grabbed my iPad and Apple pencil and gave it a go to find out that I could indeed draw a face with just verticals lines. 


I tried a few combinations and the decided I had gone as far as I could do I'd try horizontal lines to see the difference. I started drawing and again reached the end after about five variations. I was about to call it quits with a warm glow on my face when I suddenly realised. _"Vertical lines can be hair!"_


Suddenly a whole host of new options were open to me as hair, then beards and more facial hair became a possibility. Then I realised ears could be shown with vertical lines and even piercings. I had given up to easily and almost missed out on a whole world of extra possibilities by not spending more time thinking and experimenting. 


Obviously drawing a face with just vertical lines isn't exactly a revolution or really something any of us will need to do on a day to day basis but it was fun and the main lesson ‚Äîto not give up easily and keep exploring an idea ‚Äî is very useful for everyday life. 


*I believe this idea was a synthesis of practicing faces based of Activities from [@Rohdesign](https://micro.blog/Rohdesign) and [Austin Kleon](http://austinkleon.com)
