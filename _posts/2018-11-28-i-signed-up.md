I signed up to a course to learn how to use a drawing app on the iPad better. I had a survey about why I signed up and most of the answers suggested that people want to learn about how to turn their art in to a business. I have no interest in that and it actually made completing the survey difficult! 
I understand the idea of trying to segment your course attendees and then up sell a business course (everything seems to have a premium turn your ... into a business course now) but it really shocked me how â€œOf course you want to do this" it was this time. 
What's wrong with doing something #justforfun
