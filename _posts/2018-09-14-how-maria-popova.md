I noticed something about Brain Picking's blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle. 
> _“The most regretful people on earth,”_ Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, _“are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.”_
- [Walt Witman on Creativity](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/)

It's a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an "open loop” where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style. 

> “Everything can be taken from a man,” Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, “but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.” 
- [Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/)

However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.

> The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, “the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.” 
- [Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita’s Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/)

Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it's a shorter quote. 

Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.
