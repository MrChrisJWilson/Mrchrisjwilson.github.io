  <p>“The Focus Course helped me create a manageable plan of action that worked with my work and lifestyle that I could easily implement.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Me</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I noticed the Focus Course had reopened today and my testimonial (the one above from being one of the initial beta testers) is still there. This made me reflect on the course and what has changed since then.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve got married</li>
  <li>I bought a home</li>
  <li>I welcomed my daughter into the world</li>
  <li>and I changed job</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s more that’s occured of course, but these points — espeically the last point — really highlight The Focus Course’s legacy in my life. At the end of the Focus Course, I had set several core goals, I also chose a simple habit to impliment, the one which would lead to the biggest impact on my life. It was to “do a fitstar workout everyday” to help move toward my health goal. Now I go to the gym twice a week, have hit the weight goal I was aiming for (I have trouble with being underweight) and am much healthier than before.</p>

<p>In work, I left my job as a teacher this summer and became a content writer. It was a long term professional goal to write for a living but one that felt so distant. Still, I kept writing. This habit with sprint targets kept me moving and eventually someone noticed. I wouldn’t have followed this path were it not for the Focus Course.</p>

<h2 id="setbacks-along-the-way">Setbacks along the way</h2>
<p>There have been setbacks along the way. I’ve had periods of distraction — I’ve recently noticed that I am distracted more by my phone than before — and some goals didn’t work out. I’ve tried things and changed my mind. I’ve had periods where I didn’t even check on my goals. But I can still access the Focus Course and have redone the course twice since I first took it.</p>

<p>I’m about to restart the course again and I’m sure it will be different this time. For instance, I have a daughter now and this is new. Certianly some of the task will end up differently.</p>

<h2 id="you-should-do-the-focus-course">You should do the Focus Course</h2>
<p>The focus course isn’t cheap but it is one of the most life changing things I’ve done in my life. The method of learning is one that I’ve tired to use in learning courses I’ve set up and if you stick to it, it will make a difference.</p>

<p><em>I have no affiliate relationship with the focus course, this recommendation is just that. A heartfelt recommendation of something that will make a difference for you.</em></p>
