      <p>Six years ago, when I was living in Spain, I was obsessed by Productivity. I tried to make my system as efficient as possible, using the best apps to help me get things done and spending hours a week listening to podcast on the topic. 
Of course, the irony was that I spent more time learning to be more productive than actually being productive. It’s easy to look down on that with hindsight as I now know many of the fundamental principles and ideas which help with productivity but back then I didn’t. At the same time, I don’t really care for listening about productivity advice (especially as an isolated topic) anymore, I know that the thing that would make the biggest difference for myself is applying what I already know, not learning something new.</p>

<h2 id="the-20-that-takes-you-80-of-the-way">The 20% that takes you 80% of the way</h2>
<p>Just like everything, there are a few core productivity principles which take you a long way. Applying those will be more beneficial than spending hours trying to learn the other 80%. Unfortunately that means doing stuff rather than sitting back and listening or reading. I’m not certain on what this 20% is exactly  – and it may well vary a bit for you – but the things that make the biggest difference for me include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting a good nights sleep</li>
  <li>Doing some regular exercise</li>
  <li>Not eating too much bad stuff (it makes me feel tired and bloated)</li>
  <li>Listing the key things I need to work on and do today</li>
  <li>Writing down the steps in a project and marking the next step</li>
  <li>If I don’t know what the next step is, thinking of whom I could ask to find out</li>
  <li>Doing a task straight away if it will take 2 mins or less</li>
  <li>Saving tasks as soon as I can</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="perhaps-i-needed-to-be-an-addict">Perhaps I needed to be an addict?</h2>
<p>I was originally going to write a bit of a rant against productivity culture where people constantly seek that extra trick (or worse app) that will help them <em>finally</em> be productive (spoiler, no matter how productive you are, you can always be more productive and even if you do reach 100% productivity, you will still wish you could do more.) but as I started writing I realized I was (partially) wrong. Those earlier experienced actually help me greatly today and just because I don’t need to hear that advice, doesn’t mean others don’t.</p>

<p>Still, I wonder if most people who are concerned about being productivity would be better served spending more time <strong>doing</strong> than consuming about productivity.</p>
