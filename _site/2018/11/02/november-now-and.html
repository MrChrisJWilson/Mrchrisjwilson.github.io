      <p>Last month I tried updating my <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/now/">Now page</a> at the start of the month and <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/10/01/now-and-then.html">writing a description of what had occurred</a>, and what is coming up. It’s kind of a “monthly review” for me.</p>

<p>So here’s my November 2018 Now and Then Update</p>

<h2 id="then">Then</h2>

<p><strong>Goals</strong>
My goals for last month were a mixed bag
 Spend time with my daughter</p>
<ul>
  <li>I caught up with the copyblogger course I’m doing and now just need to submit some work.</li>
  <li>I did nothing for “the ninja project” and it’s probably on the back burner unfortunately.</li>
  <li>I read very little more of On Writing Well but I did read some. I’m hoping to slowly continue this month</li>
  <li>I did try a couple of calligraphy styles, but the main thing I did was investigate the Pentel brush pen by doing Inktober only using that pen. It was a really fun challenge to try an unusual and different pen. I kind of want to do something similar with a different pen next month and see what comes up.</li>
  <li>My writing portfolio still needs a bit of an update but it’s coming along well</li>
  <li>I did nothing for NaNoWriMo but I’m going to start free writing everyday, it may lead to a book, or not. Hopefully it will stick beyond just November.</li>
  <li>I didn’t plan to, but I ended up completing Inktober and I’m going to put a micro.blog post with every image.</li>
  <li>I spent far too much time considering what new phone I should get. I had placed some limits and requirements to stop me upgrading sooner and they were now all met. However, I didn’t want to blindly follow my gut but really check and make sure I was making a good choice that reflecting a suitable use of money. At times like this I like to review why I don’t use certain products and consider what it would be like to switch system as well as the pain points. In this case I really considered getting an Android phone. There are certainly some advantages but I’ve happily decided against doing so, I placed one last restriction on myself to give myself time to make sure I was happy with my final decision and so in a week or so, I should upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Events</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>My parents visited and met their Granddaughter</li>
  <li>My in-laws visited again and we prepared some great food.</li>
  <li>We went to a wedding in Lublin</li>
  <li>I had a major project at work that was a great challenge, but quite stressful.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unexpected delights</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting reading Atomic Habits by James Clear</li>
  <li>Getting back in to exercising after some illness</li>
  <li>David Sparks Omnifocus field guide provided some really interesting ideas.</li>
  <li>I’ve really got back into Jazz music again.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>
<p>Last time I talked about goals, this month (inspired by James Clear) I want to focus on habits instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily writing first thing (instead of browsing and searching the internet)</li>
  <li>Playing some Jazz guitar at the weekend</li>
  <li>Personalizing a couple more Siri Shortcuts so they are more useful</li>
  <li>Going through a couple of courses I signed up for in the past…and did nothing with!</li>
  <li>I’m looking for a better way to manage quotes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upcoming events</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>My wife’s birthday</li>
  <li>Some national holidays (1st November and 11th)</li>
</ul>
