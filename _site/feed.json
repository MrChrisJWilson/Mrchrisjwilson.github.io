It‚Äôs partially because it has such wonderful sounds that flow smoothly into each other ‚Äì no fricatives to be found here.

Of warm drinks, Golden colours and beautiful sunrises and sunsets. \nHeat and energy radiate out of it at all times, be that in the mid-day sun, the new fashion items to wear or the red leaves that now lie on the ground.</p>\n\n<p>This warmth is something I try and live out in my life, not just in this season but always.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>To share what I have with those in need, and not.</li>\n  <li>To be friendly even when people aren‚Äôt friendly to me (I‚Äôve found this more difficult recently)</li>\n  <li>and to gather those closest to me whenever I can.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Admittedly ‚ÄúFall‚Äù has some similar phonetic qualities but I can‚Äôt divorce it from its other meaning.

As I scrolled my timeline I saw a new post and didn‚Äôt immediately click. I looked at the title, considered what it might be about and weather that would be relevant or interesting to me. Of course I also weighted the profile who was recommending this post into my equation.</p>\n\n<p>I am incredibly thankful that microblog hasn‚Äôt descended into linkpost, clickbait and their ilk butit doesn‚Äôt change the fact that headlines and titles are still one of, if not <strong>the</strong> key factor in me choosing to read a post or not.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>After a session at the <a href=\"https://sketchnotecamp.wordpress.com\">International Sketchnote camp in Lisbon</a> today I felt challenged and excited to share more of my sketchnoting online. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve resisted doing because I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm as good as others and I know that there are sometimes mistakes in my sketchnotes: crooked lines, spelling, running out of space. I was, however, reminded of the value of <strong>sharing your work</strong> as you go along and that, in reality, the process is what is really of value not the product.</p>\n\n<p>But how could I start? What step would be the easiest to get me to share more of my sketchnotes.</p>\n\n<p>The first step.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, this would be <strong>taking the photo of the sketchnote to share</strong>. If I don‚Äôt take the picture, I‚Äôve got nothing to share. Once I‚Äôve taken the photo then I‚Äôve got something to share and it‚Äôs fairly simple to type out a note and share the sketchnote from there. But taking the photo is a hanging point for me. I often don‚Äôt take my phone out, and when it is I forget to/ resist take the photos.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if I don‚Äôt share a sketchnote after photographing it, immediately or after a wait, I still have the sketchnote save and more available to share.</p>\n\n<p>I think this applied to many other areas. Just doing the first step can get the process going.</p>\n\n",

With exceptions, podcast tend towards entertainment over content. I don‚Äôt think there is anything inherently wrong with that. <strong>It‚Äôs good to switch off and be entertained from time to time but not all the time.</strong>\nStill greater intentionality is always good, as is <a href=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/09/09/protect-your-attention.html\">protecting your attention</a>.</p>\n",

It is influenced by the classic experience of shooting black and white film, with two iconic film simulations, but does so in a non typical way. Most camera apps aim to show you want you are going to see in the end result, Emulsify recreates the unpredictability of film in that you see things in colour before getting your Black and white results. This means you have to train your eye a bit to think about shades and tone and not just colour differences. \nIt‚Äôs a very different camera app experience that I suspect some won‚Äôt like, but personally I‚Äôm hooked. That‚Äôs perhaps less surprising considering the amount of black and white film I‚Äôve been burning through recently.

The feel I usually get from tech journalists who write photo advice focus more on the tech side of photos (surprise). So they‚Äôll really get into the <em>‚Äúneed‚Äù</em> for a super fast lens, getting a tone of bokeh and finally some classic composition tips like ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù (all of which can be broken).
