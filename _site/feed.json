Personally, I used my iPad Air in portrait more than my Pro because the Smart Keyboard can <strong>only</strong> be used in landscape. And that’s a shame.  </p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>So after this week <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/mpu/417\">Mac Power users podcast</a> I finally got round to signing up for Micro.Blog. I had been meaning to do so for a bit, especially after seeing people like <a href=\"http://decoding.io/\">Zsolt Benke at decoding</a> using the service on their own site. However I wondered if I should use it on my own site or whatever. In the end, I signed up for a Micro.blog blog as I wanted to help support the service as well. Paying $5 seems like a good way to do so and solved my overthinking. </p>\n\n<p>So why did I sign up in the first place. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-increasing-announance-at-social-media-twitter\">My increasing announance at Social Media (twitter)</h2>\n<p>I’ve increasingly felt that social media is very “meh”. I hate what Facebook has become as it increasingly tried to grab my attention with cheap tricks and tracks everything I do (no matter if I try to stop that). Twitter too isn’t perfect with its lack of efforts to stop trolling and abuse. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-announance-at-blogging\">My announance at blogging</h2>\n<p>Likewise I’m fed up of the “professional blogging culture”. There are so many “have tos” with blogging now like:<br />\n- write long posts\n- have links\n- be helpful\n- only show the good sides\n- no link posts\n- be on a single focus topic\nAnd so on and so on. \nAll great advice if you want to make money, but as <a href=\"https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/welcome-back-blogging\">CJ Chilvers says</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“one is a business model, one is a life model” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s what I’m hoping for in this site. Somewhere to play, somewhere to create and somewhere to be unprofessional. </p>\n",
