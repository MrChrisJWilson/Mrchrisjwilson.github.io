It‚Äôs almost impossible to find new opinions because everyone links to the same three websites, like I‚Äôm doing now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A lot of voices have moved on to podcasting. Frankly, as someone that also podcasts, it‚Äôs easier and there‚Äôs less accountability than with blogging. Today, I also see a lot of thoughtful people writing on Discord groups. There‚Äôs little value in blogging unless you just like to practice writing in public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one of those articles that starts discussing one issue, but the commentary actually is far more interesting than the inital discussion (In my opinion at least). I wonder how accurate Gabe‚Äôs prognosis is (that new voices are podcasting). While I see truth in this, I also think one of the issues is that online writing has become quite formulaic and people simply copy others ideas without offering something fresh. \nNo one could be a full time blogger in the early days of online writing, now there are a host of them (and companies that employ writers) who‚Äôs opinions are well regarded. I‚Äôve started (and stopped) following some new writers as I realised they were just repeating others points. At the same time, I have discovered fresh voices who offer something unique.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/\">Rose Orchard</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://beardyguycreative.com/blog/\">Denny Henke</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://decoding.io/\">Zsolt Benke</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gr36.com/\">Greg Morris</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://thedent.net/\">Andy Nicolaides</a>\nAdmittedly some of those same voices also use their litteral voices for podcasts too, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that they are adding their unique writing voice. Really, it‚Äôs not that writing is in decline, it‚Äôs that more writers are also professional podcasters.</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<blockquote>\n  <p>‚ÄúThe Focus Course helped me create a manageable plan of action that worked with my work and lifestyle that I could easily implement.‚Äù</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Me</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I noticed the Focus Course had reopened today and my testimonial (the one above from being one of the initial beta testers) is still there. This made me reflect on the course and what has changed since then.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I‚Äôve got married</li>\n  <li>I bought a home</li>\n  <li>I welcomed my daughter into the world</li>\n  <li>and I changed job</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs more that‚Äôs occured of course, but these points ‚Äî espeically the last point ‚Äî really highlight The Focus Course‚Äôs legacy in my life. At the end of the Focus Course, I had set several core goals, I also chose a simple habit to impliment, the one which would lead to the biggest impact on my life. It was to ‚Äúdo a fitstar workout everyday‚Äù to help move toward my health goal. Now I go to the gym twice a week, have hit the weight goal I was aiming for (I have trouble with being underweight) and am much healthier than before.</p>\n\n<p>In work, I left my job as a teacher this summer and became a content writer. It was a long term professional goal to write for a living but one that felt so distant. Still, I kept writing. This habit with sprint targets kept me moving and eventually someone noticed. I wouldn‚Äôt have followed this path were it not for the Focus Course.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"setbacks-along-the-way\">Setbacks along the way</h2>\n<p>There have been setbacks along the way. I‚Äôve had periods of distraction ‚Äî I‚Äôve recently noticed that I am distracted more by my phone than before ‚Äî and some goals didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve tried things and changed my mind. I‚Äôve had periods where I didn‚Äôt even check on my goals. But I can still access the Focus Course and have redone the course twice since I first took it.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm about to restart the course again and I‚Äôm sure it will be different this time. For instance, I have a daughter now and this is new. Certianly some of the task will end up differently.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"you-should-do-the-focus-course\">You should do the Focus Course</h2>\n<p>The focus course isn‚Äôt cheap but it is one of the most life changing things I‚Äôve done in my life. The method of learning is one that I‚Äôve tired to use in learning courses I‚Äôve set up and if you stick to it, it will make a difference.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thefocuscourse.com/course/\">You can sign up here.</a></p>\n\n<p><em>I have no affiliate relationship with the focus course, this recommendation is just that. A heartfelt recommendation of something that will make a difference for you.</em></p>\n",
