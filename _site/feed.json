			"title": "Hoping to Be Delighted by Apple",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Well it’s Apple iPhone event day and I feel conflicted.</p>\n\n<p>I’m really ready for a phone upgrade, I want to pass my current phone on to my wife<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> so we can share Live Photos of my daughter, plus then she won’t have a terrible battery life. But I feel a bit nervous. <strong>I’m worried Apple won’t give me a reason to upgrade today.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It’s a funny fear to have, that someone <strong>won’t</strong> make you want to give them money. No doubt I’ll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I’d want to upgrade but at the same time I’m really not sure where they go next with smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I’m intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn’t seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, I’ll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don’t see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\">\n      <p>For the record, I’d buy her a new phone but she is very resistant to spending money on herself. <a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n",

That’s usually a sign to take notice of an idea, when it keeps coming up. It’s also part of the value of a commonplace book, you can notice the themes and ideas that come up again and again and see patterns and connections emerging over time.</p>\n\n<p>Attention is one of our most valuable resources and yet nowadays it feels like it’s given away for so little. Even giving away your Email address for some freebie is an invitation to take some of your attention.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve made a few changes recently to try and protect my attention more but I know that I both don’t stick to all of those changes and they don’t go far enough.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Focusing on longer and deeper content</li>\n  <li>planning silence</li>\n  <li>limiting disctration time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They’ve all helped but the issue persists.

			"title": "On Writing Your Job on Your About Page",
			
			"content_html": "<p>This week I realised that I could add an about page to my Micro.Blog blog and it could be longer than the mini about desciption in my Micro.blog profile (thanks <a href=\"https://micro.blog/simonwood\">@simonwood</a>). As I was writing it, I did the classic thing that I’ve heard the folk at <a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/do/\">The minimalists podcast</a> complain about. <strong>I used my job title to describe myself</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In facts, I used my job title as my <strong>primary</strong> description of myself. This is the natural and expected course of action. When we meet someone new, one of the first few questions is usually <em>“and what do you do?”</em> which really means _“What’s your job?” and potentially, “how much do you earn and are you worth my time”.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the second part is the highly cynical take from the minimalists which I somewhat agree with. At the same time, if you do a 9-to-5 job, the chances are you spend 1/3 of your day doing that thing (then a further third sleeping) meaning you probably do spend most of your time doing your job.</p>\n\n<p>My last job was a teacher, it’s a pretty well respected thing to include in your profile. People generally think teachers are okay but not necessarily useful for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>My new job is a title I really like, <strong>“Content Writer”</strong> which is a way to say <em>“copywriter but we pay you less”</em> and it reflects a lot of what I like doing, researching and write. But in truth, it’s not a full representation of my character and what I do.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried a different <a href=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/about/\">About page</a> here, one that focuses on actions and personality traits I want to exhibit first rather than where my paycheck comes from. I’m sure I’ll revisit it and update it, but it’s a start.</p>\n",

This is really not great news. I’ve used Evernote for years and been a paying member for the last three. It’s not a perfect app/service, but it does the job and in the last year the company has really improved (aka, they stopped bugging me about workchat). Still, stuff like this suggests that things may not be so hot, I’d better look for an alternative and a way to move all my notes out.</p>\n",

			"title": "Thoughts on the film \"Chef\" ",
			
			"content_html": "<p>I re-watched the film with my wife over the last two days. It’s a film I’ve wanted to revisit for a while but I knew I needed a bit of time. There’s a few storytelling elements that I really love in the film.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s the super short summary</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the critic at the start of the film is right.</li>\n  <li>Carl’s relationship with his son is the most important storyline</li>\n  <li>Restoring that relationship leads to his professional success</li>\n  <li>The final crisis is all of his own creating and echos the start of the film</li>\n  <li>He ends no longer needing the critics approval.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-critic-is-right\">The critic is right.</h2>\n<p>Yeah, he’s blunt and rude with his criticism but he totally highlights Carl’s issues. He has no creative control (which Carl doesn’t realise at the start) and so his food is bland. Is he really a hater? I’ve seen this online sometimes where unless someone applauds your every move, they are a hater. You can’t offer constructive criticism because any criticism means you are a hater. To be fair, the words the critic uses are attacking the character of Carl so maybe he is a hater…in this case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-storyline-with-his-son-is-more-important-than-his-professional-career\">The storyline with his son is more important than his professional career</h2>\n<p>His professional career brilliantly mimics his relationship with his son (and was something I didn’t note when I first watched). At the start, he is just going through the motions with his son just as he is going through the motions at work. The difference is that he <em>wants</em> to be more creative with his work, he just can’t. With his son, he doesn’t seem to want to put in the effort because he is distracted by work.</p>\n\n<p>The low point of his career is the low point of his relationship with his son. He goes viral on the internet, loses his job and cancels his plans with his son. This is the “dark night of the soul” moment of the film, where he is directionless and doesn’t know what to do. He has realised his problems in his last job, lack of creative control and stagnation, but he now has no options so he pushes his son away? We all know its the wrong option but it is understandable. He feels useless and doesn’t want his son to see him like this (oh hi pride).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"by-sorting-out-his-relationship-with-his-son-it-leads-to-his-work-life-improving\">By sorting out his relationship with his son, it leads to his work life improving.</h2>\n\n<p>Taking care of his son leads to him getting the idea for his food truck, he’s been presented with the idea before, but now he accepts it <strong>after</strong> his relationship is improving.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-final-crisis-is-different-from-the-typical-heros-journey\">The final crisis is different from the typical “Hero’s journey”</h2>\n<p>The classic hero’s journey usually takes a different path, we usually have a bigger final conflict where the hero re-faces their old enemy. In Chef it is returning home. Carl starts to take the wrong path and pushes Percy away, but he changes his mind and this leads to our happy ever after ending.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"carl-no-longer-needs-the-critics-approval-but-gets-it-anyway\">Carl no longer needs the critics approval, but gets it anyway</h2>\n<p>This including the critic who tells Carl that he’s back on track. The best touch of this is that Carl no longer cares about the critic, he doesn’t <em>need</em> to impress the critic unlike the start of the film where he is dependent on his review. \nIt helps to show his progress, but it isn’t as dramatic as the classic hero’s journey and facing the emperor on the death star.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"useful-storytelling-ideas\">Useful storytelling ideas</h2>\n<p>I really like the storytelling devices that Chef uses, some of the shots are great too. It’s not a high stakes thriller but it is a great feel good film.</p>\n\n",
