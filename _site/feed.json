Quentin Tarantino says he likes to read his scripts to his friends, not for their feedback, but their presence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want input, I don‚Äôt want you to tell me if I‚Äôm doing anything wrong, heavens forbid,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúBut I write a scene, and I think I‚Äôve heard it as much as I can, but then when I read it to you ‚Ä¶ I hear it through your ears, and it lets me know I‚Äôm on the right track.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I use this trick with proofreading texts. Sometimes I have to look at the same thing that‚Äôs been sent back and forth about five times, often with a minor change introduced that is easily missed. Reading aloud is one of the only ways to keep my eyes fresh.</p>\n",

But I feel a bit nervous. <strong>I‚Äôm worried Apple won‚Äôt give me a reason to upgrade today.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs a funny fear to have, that someone <strong>won‚Äôt</strong> make you want to give them money. No doubt I‚Äôll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I‚Äôd want to upgrade but at the same time I‚Äôm really not sure where they go next with smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I‚Äôm intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn‚Äôt seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, I‚Äôll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don‚Äôt see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\">\n      <p>For the record, I‚Äôd buy her a new phone but she is very resistant to spending money on herself.¬†<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n",
