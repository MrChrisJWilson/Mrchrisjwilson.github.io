			"content_html": "<p>So I’ve seen someone write and share an article that is surprisingly similar to one I wrote and only a day later. Mine was an “evergreen” topic but admittedly one that others have written about before. Chances are that this is just one of those strange coninsidences where <strong>actually</strong> we’re both being influenced by the same environment and so are getting the same sources of inspiration leading to similar/the same topic…But even as I write this, I realise this is actually the second time in just over a week. I’m not sure if this means I’m less original than I though…or someone’s copying my ideas? Either way, no one cares who has what idea, it’s the execution that matters.  </p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>One of the things I’ve found really strange on the internet are the sort of “pyramid” schemes. You know, the internet marketer, who teaches you internet marketing, so you too can become an internet marketer, in internet marketing. Or the writer, who writes books, on how to write books…about writing books. Or the YouTuber who makes YouTube videos about how you can make YouTube videos. Obviously not everyone who does internet marketing or teachers internet marketing <em>only</em> does internet marketing or <em>only</em> has experience in this field, but there are plenty of other “fake it till you make it” folk, and it’s telling when they seem to produce people who do the exact same thing (just less successfully). \nI’ll add, that It’s also why I find the sketchnote community concerning sometimes. Some people only seem to share sketchnotes of how to sketchnote…and that’s pretty weird. </p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>So after this week <a href=\"https://www.relay.fm/mpu/417\">Mac Power users podcast</a> I finally got round to signing up for Micro.Blog. I had been meaning to do so for a bit, especially after seeing people like <a href=\"http://decoding.io/\">Zsolt Benke at decoding</a> using the service on their own site. However I wondered if I should use it on my own site or whatever. In the end, I signed up for a Micro.blog blog as I wanted to help support the service as well. Paying $5 seems like a good way to do so and solved my overthinking. </p>\n\n<p>So why did I sign up in the first place. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-increasing-announance-at-social-media-twitter\">My increasing announance at Social Media (twitter)</h2>\n<p>I’ve increasingly felt that social media is very “meh”. I hate what Facebook has become as it increasingly tried to grab my attention with cheap tricks and tracks everything I do (no matter if I try to stop that). Twitter too isn’t perfect with its lack of efforts to stop trolling and abuse. </p>\n\n<h2 id=\"my-announance-at-blogging\">My announance at blogging</h2>\n<p>Likewise I’m fed up of the “professional blogging culture”. There are so many “have tos” with blogging now like:<br />\n- write long posts\n- have links\n- be helpful\n- only show the good sides\n- no link posts\n- be on a single focus topic\nAnd so on and so on. \nAll great advice if you want to make money, but as <a href=\"https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/welcome-back-blogging\">CJ Chilvers says</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“one is a business model, one is a life model” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s what I’m hoping for in this site. Somewhere to play, somewhere to create and somewhere to be unprofessional. </p>\n",
