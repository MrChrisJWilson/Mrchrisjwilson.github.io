			"content_html": "<p><a href=\"http://www.macdrifter.com/2018/11/daring-fireball-dan-frakes-goes-to-apple-as-mac-app-store-editor.html\">Daring Fireball: Dan Frakes Goes to Apple as Mac App Store Editor</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Cross linking between blogs has nearly dried up. It‚Äôs almost impossible to find new opinions because everyone links to the same three websites, like I‚Äôm doing now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A lot of voices have moved on to podcasting. Frankly, as someone that also podcasts, it‚Äôs easier and there‚Äôs less accountability than with blogging. Today, I also see a lot of thoughtful people writing on Discord groups. There‚Äôs little value in blogging unless you just like to practice writing in public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one of those articles that starts discussing one issue, but the commentary actually is far more interesting than the inital discussion (In my opinion at least). I wonder how accurate Gabe‚Äôs prognosis is (that new voices are podcasting). While I see truth in this, I also think one of the issues is that online writing has become quite formulaic and people simply copy others ideas without offering something fresh. \nNo one could be a full time blogger in the early days of online writing, now there are a host of them (and companies that employ writers) who‚Äôs opinions are well regarded. I‚Äôve started (and stopped) following some new writers as I realised they were just repeating others points. At the same time, I have discovered fresh voices who offer something unique.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/\">Rose Orchard</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"[beardyguycreative.com/blog/](http://beardyguycreative.com/blog/)\">Denny Henke</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://decoding.io/\">Zsolt Benke</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gr36.com/\">Greg Morris</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://thedent.net/\">Andy Nicolaides</a>\nAdmittedly some of those same voices also use their litteral voices for podcasts too, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that they are adding their unique writing voice. Really, it‚Äôs not that writing is in decline, it‚Äôs that more writers are also professional podcasters.</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"title": "A Long-Term Review of The Focus Course",
			
			"content_html": "<blockquote>\n  <p>‚ÄúThe Focus Course helped me create a manageable plan of action that worked with my work and lifestyle that I could easily implement.‚Äù</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Me</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I noticed the Focus Course had reopened today and my testimonial (the one above from being one of the initial beta testers) is still there. This made me reflect on the course and what has changed since then.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I‚Äôve got married</li>\n  <li>I bought a home</li>\n  <li>I welcomed my daughter into the world</li>\n  <li>and I changed job</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There‚Äôs more that‚Äôs occured of course, but these points ‚Äî espeically the last point ‚Äî really highlight The Focus Course‚Äôs legacy in my life. At the end of the Focus Course, I had set several core goals, I also chose a simple habit to impliment, the one which would lead to the biggest impact on my life. It was to ‚Äúdo a fitstar workout everyday‚Äù to help move toward my health goal. Now I go to the gym twice a week, have hit the weight goal I was aiming for (I have trouble with being underweight) and am much healthier than before.</p>\n\n<p>In work, I left my job as a teacher this summer and became a content writer. It was a long term professional goal to write for a living but one that felt so distant. Still, I kept writing. This habit with sprint targets kept me moving and eventually someone noticed. I wouldn‚Äôt have followed this path were it not for the Focus Course.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"setbacks-along-the-way\">Setbacks along the way</h2>\n<p>There have been setbacks along the way. I‚Äôve had periods of distraction ‚Äî I‚Äôve recently noticed that I am distracted more by my phone than before ‚Äî and some goals didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve tried things and changed my mind. I‚Äôve had periods where I didn‚Äôt even check on my goals. But I can still access the Focus Course and have redone the course twice since I first took it.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm about to restart the course again and I‚Äôm sure it will be different this time. For instance, I have a daughter now and this is new. Certianly some of the task will end up differently.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"you-should-do-the-focus-course\">You should do the Focus Course</h2>\n<p>The focus course isn‚Äôt cheap but it is one of the most life changing things I‚Äôve done in my life. The method of learning is one that I‚Äôve tired to use in learning courses I‚Äôve set up and if you stick to it, it will make a difference.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thefocuscourse.com/course/\">You can sign up here.</a></p>\n\n<p><em>I have no affiliate relationship with the focus course, this recommendation is just that. A heartfelt recommendation of something that will make a difference for you.</em></p>\n",

I agree more with the ‚Äúprincipled limited‚Äù screen usage. There‚Äôs an incredible depth of knowledge on the internet including things like YouTube (I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been a better time to learn a musical instrument and I‚Äôm brushing up my jazz guitar chops) but YouTube is designed to get you hooked and spend more time there, and often the brain dead stuff is the most addictive.

I tried to make my system as efficient as possible, using the best apps to help me get things done and spending hours a week listening to podcast on the topic. \nOf course, the irony was that I spent more time learning to be more productive than actually being productive. It‚Äôs easy to look down on that with hindsight as I now know many of the fundamental principles and ideas which help with productivity but back then I didn‚Äôt. At the same time, I don‚Äôt really care for listening about productivity advice (especially as an isolated topic) anymore, I know that the thing that would make the biggest difference for myself is applying what I already know, not learning something new.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-20-that-takes-you-80-of-the-way\">The 20% that takes you 80% of the way</h2>\n<p>Just like everything, there are a few core productivity principles which take you a long way. Applying those will be more beneficial than spending hours trying to learn the other 80%. Unfortunately that means doing stuff rather than sitting back and listening or reading. I‚Äôm not certain on what this 20% is exactly  ‚Äì and it may well vary a bit for you ‚Äì but the things that make the biggest difference for me include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Getting a good nights sleep</li>\n  <li>Doing some regular exercise</li>\n  <li>Not eating too much bad stuff (it makes me feel tired and bloated)</li>\n  <li>Listing the key things I need to work on and do today</li>\n  <li>Writing down the steps in a project and marking the next step</li>\n  <li>If I don‚Äôt know what the next step is, thinking of whom I could ask to find out</li>\n  <li>Doing a task straight away if it will take 2 mins or less</li>\n  <li>Saving tasks as soon as I can</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"perhaps-i-needed-to-be-an-addict\">Perhaps I needed to be an addict?</h2>\n<p>I was originally going to write a bit of a rant against productivity culture where people constantly seek that extra trick (or worse app) that will help them <em>finally</em> be productive (spoiler, no matter how productive you are, you can always be more productive and even if you do reach 100% productivity, you will still wish you could do more.) but as I started writing I realized I was (partially) wrong. Those earlier experienced actually help me greatly today and just because I don‚Äôt need to hear that advice, doesn‚Äôt mean others don‚Äôt.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I wonder if most people who are concerned about being productivity would be better served spending more time <strong>doing</strong> than consuming about productivity.</p>\n",
