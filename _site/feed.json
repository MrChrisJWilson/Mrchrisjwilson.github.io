			"content_html": "<p>One of the things that annoys me the most about the modern internet landscape is how much stuff is made about making stuff. Especially when it is the same form as the thing which is being made.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Blog posts about writing blog posts</li>\n  <li>Youtube Videos about making YouTube videos</li>\n  <li>Podcasts about podcasts (this is probably the least offender)\nI now wonder if this is part of the inherit nature of being an indie creator. If you become successful and go full time, then the thing you are making becomes your full time job. What else can you write about‚Ä¶except writing about running your job.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, <strong>it‚Äôs not inevitable</strong> and I think the <strong>best</strong> online content avoids this pitfall. CGP Grey‚Äôs great videos aren‚Äôt about how he makes his videos, Amanda Palmer‚Äôs music isn‚Äôt about making music and Andy Weir wrote a great book about a man on mars on his blog.</p>\n\n<p>My challenge to myself is to focus more on making things, and not making things about making things.</p>\n\n",

As a result, parents who are busy, distracted or can‚Äôt afford to spend as much 1:1 time as they‚Äôd like are unknowingly encouraging their kids to become digital zombies, with a constant need for stimulation, who are being manipulated by digital overlords to click and click some more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the past in Europe, pale skin was seen as attractive, as people who were suntanned worked in the fields. Now, the reverse is true as it is a sign of not working to have travel abroad and obtained your tan. This digital situation reminds me of getting tanned, the element which distinguished you in the past was access to the internet, now it is being able to disconnect.</p>\n\n<p>Also see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455586692/?tag=minima0e-20\">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> (affiliate link)</p>\n",

It‚Äôs almost impossible to find new opinions because everyone links to the same three websites, like I‚Äôm doing now.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A lot of voices have moved on to podcasting. Frankly, as someone that also podcasts, it‚Äôs easier and there‚Äôs less accountability than with blogging. Today, I also see a lot of thoughtful people writing on Discord groups. There‚Äôs little value in blogging unless you just like to practice writing in public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is one of those articles that starts discussing one issue, but the commentary actually is far more interesting than the inital discussion (In my opinion at least). I wonder how accurate Gabe‚Äôs prognosis is (that new voices are podcasting). While I see truth in this, I also think one of the issues is that online writing has become quite formulaic and people simply copy others ideas without offering something fresh. \nNo one could be a full time blogger in the early days of online writing, now there are a host of them (and companies that employ writers) who‚Äôs opinions are well regarded. I‚Äôve started (and stopped) following some new writers as I realised they were just repeating others points. At the same time, I have discovered fresh voices who offer something unique.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://rosemaryorchard.com/\">Rose Orchard</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://beardyguycreative.com/blog/\">Denny Henke</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"http://decoding.io/\">Zsolt Benke</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.gr36.com/\">Greg Morris</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://thedent.net/\">Andy Nicolaides</a>\nAdmittedly some of those same voices also use their litteral voices for podcasts too, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that they are adding their unique writing voice. Really, it‚Äôs not that writing is in decline, it‚Äôs that more writers are also professional podcasters.</li>\n</ul>\n",
