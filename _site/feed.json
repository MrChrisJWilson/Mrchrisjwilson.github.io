			"title": "How Maria Popova starts a blog post. ",
			
			"content_html": "<p>I noticed something about Brain Picking‚Äôs blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>‚ÄúThe most regretful people on earth,‚Äù</em> Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, <em>‚Äúare those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.‚Äù</em></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/\">Walt Witman on Creativity</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an ‚Äúopen loop‚Äù where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man,‚Äù Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, ‚Äúbut one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äî to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/\">Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, ‚Äúthe whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.‚Äù</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/\">Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita‚Äôs Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it‚Äôs a shorter quote.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.</p>\n",

Quentin Tarantino says he likes to read his scripts to his friends, not for their feedback, but their presence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want input, I don‚Äôt want you to tell me if I‚Äôm doing anything wrong, heavens forbid,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúBut I write a scene, and I think I‚Äôve heard it as much as I can, but then when I read it to you ‚Ä¶ I hear it through your ears, and it lets me know I‚Äôm on the right track.‚Äù</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I use this trick with proofreading texts. Sometimes I have to look at the same thing that‚Äôs been sent back and forth about five times, often with a minor change introduced that is easily missed. Reading aloud is one of the only ways to keep my eyes fresh.</p>\n",

But I feel a bit nervous. <strong>I‚Äôm worried Apple won‚Äôt give me a reason to upgrade today.</strong></p>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs a funny fear to have, that someone <strong>won‚Äôt</strong> make you want to give them money. No doubt I‚Äôll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I‚Äôd want to upgrade but at the same time I‚Äôm really not sure where they go next with smartphones.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I‚Äôm intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn‚Äôt seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, I‚Äôll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don‚Äôt see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\">\n      <p>For the record, I‚Äôd buy her a new phone but she is very resistant to spending money on herself.¬†<a href=\"#fnref:1\" class=\"reversefootnote\">&#8617;</a></p>\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n</div>\n",
