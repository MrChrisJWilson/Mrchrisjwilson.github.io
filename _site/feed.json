			"content_html": "<p>After a session at the <a href=\"https://sketchnotecamp.wordpress.com\">International Sketchnote camp in Lisbon</a> today I felt challenged and excited to share more of my sketchnoting online. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve resisted doing because I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm as good as others and I know that there are sometimes mistakes in my sketchnotes: crooked lines, spelling, running out of space. I was, however, reminded of the value of <strong>sharing your work</strong> as you go along and that, in reality, the process is what is really of value not the product.</p>\n\n<p>But how could I start? What step would be the easiest to get me to share more of my sketchnotes.</p>\n\n<p>The first step.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, this would be <strong>taking the photo of the sketchnote to share</strong>. If I don‚Äôt take the picture, I‚Äôve got nothing to share. Once I‚Äôve taken the photo then I‚Äôve got something to share and it‚Äôs fairly simple to type out a note and share the sketchnote from there. But taking the photo is a hanging point for me. I often don‚Äôt take my phone out, and when it is I forget to/ resist take the photos.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if I don‚Äôt share a sketchnote after photographing it, immediately or after a wait, I still have the sketchnote save and more available to share.</p>\n\n<p>I think this applied to many other areas. Just doing the first step can get the process going.</p>\n\n",

With exceptions, podcast tend towards entertainment over content. I don‚Äôt think there is anything inherently wrong with that. <strong>It‚Äôs good to switch off and be entertained from time to time but not all the time.</strong>\nStill greater intentionality is always good, as is <a href=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/09/09/protect-your-attention.html\">protecting your attention</a>.</p>\n",

It is influenced by the classic experience of shooting black and white film, with two iconic film simulations, but does so in a non typical way. Most camera apps aim to show you want you are going to see in the end result, Emulsify recreates the unpredictability of film in that you see things in colour before getting your Black and white results. This means you have to train your eye a bit to think about shades and tone and not just colour differences. \nIt‚Äôs a very different camera app experience that I suspect some won‚Äôt like, but personally I‚Äôm hooked. That‚Äôs perhaps less surprising considering the amount of black and white film I‚Äôve been burning through recently. Now I just need to get a new iPhone to test the camera on that‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶to help Sean.</p>\n",

I love starting here rathe than ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù or whatever because all of those composition rules can be broken.</p>\n\n<p>I thought of this post as I had seen that <a href=\"https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/finally-a-photography-101-course-i-can-recommend\">CJ Chilvers had written in support</a> of the upcoming <a href=\"https://thesweetsetup.com/capturing-a-great-photo-on-iphone/\">The Sweet Setup Photo course</a>.\nHonestly, when they announced they were making photo course I was worried. The feel I usually get from tech journalists who write photo advice focus more on the tech side of photos (surprise). So they‚Äôll really get into the <em>‚Äúneed‚Äù</em> for a super fast lens, getting a tone of bokeh and finally some classic composition tips like ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù (all of which can be broken). But CJ Chilvers isn‚Äôt that type of photographer and he focuses on photos for the average person.</p>\n\n<p>That‚Äôs what made me think of this post.

			"content_html": "<p>I noticed something about Brain Picking‚Äôs blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle.</p>\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>‚ÄúThe most regretful people on earth,‚Äù</em> Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, <em>‚Äúare those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.‚Äù</em></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/\">Walt Witman on Creativity</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It‚Äôs a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an ‚Äúopen loop‚Äù where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man,‚Äù Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, ‚Äúbut one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äî to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/\">Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, ‚Äúthe whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.‚Äù</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/\">Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita‚Äôs Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska</a></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it‚Äôs a shorter quote.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.</p>\n",
