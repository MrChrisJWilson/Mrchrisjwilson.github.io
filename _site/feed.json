I think I want to give to every show, but there are some shows I don’t listen to so I think about choosing one show…but which one! If I could tick the shows I listen to I would (but that would be much harder to impliment). So I get caught in a mental loop and delay signing up. So today I (finally) signed up for “all the great shows”.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Another idea from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/?tag=minima0e-20\"><strong>perennial seller</strong> by Ryan Holiday</a>, ideas are cheap, executing really matters. So many people have a <em>“great idea for a book”</em> but a tiny fraction of those people actually even start writing (and then an even smaller fraction finish. It’s completely true and one of the key changes I made in my early twenties was moving from having ideas to trying out ideas. Later in my twenties I started getting better at finishing those same ideas and not just starting a whole host of new ones. However, that is <em>still</em> a skill I need to develop.</p>\n\n<p>I did think of <a href=\"https://jamesaltucher.com/2018/08/3-habits-transform-life/\">James Altchure’s idea factory habit (habit two)</a>. He seeks to be a constantly thinking of ideas <strong>AND</strong> reviewing them to only take action on the best ones. While ideas are cheap, we also need ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I remembered <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9OuG2b7V2sU\">Dan Aierly who described how people want to be given credit for their ideas more than the actions they take.</a> I can certainly relate and I believe that’s related to why the statement that “ideas are cheap” is so tough to stomach. We want recognition for our ideas, we believe they are valuable, but in reality no one rewards you just for ideas, they reward people for carrying out their ideas.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/e77708e0a1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I’m listening to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/\"><em>”perennial seller”</em> by Ryan Holiday</a> and early on he takes aim at this truism that’s been going around. spend 1/5th of your time creating and 4/5ths promoting. He said it sounds good but really if your products not up to snuff then you’re trying to generate interest in something which doesn’t matter. (Being cynical it could well be that the type of business advisor who passes on this advice knows that their audiences products aren’t that good).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I was curious what the biggest companies ad spend to research budget was and if this might inform a better principle/ demonstrate that the 4/5th marketing idea was wrong. So what better place to start than Apple.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apple-ad-spend-to-rnd\">Apple ad Spend to RnD</h2>\n<p>Apple’s ad spend is now not widely revealed and bundled in with its administrative costs. That’s because it’s under 10% of its expenses and so it isn’t necessary to disclose. The last available figure is from 2015 when it was $1.8 billion. Pretty high, but how did RnD compare in 2015? In fact, in 2015 RnD budget rose by $1.5 billion to aproximaately $5.9 billion. And in 2017 there was a $10 billion RnD spend target. So it’s possible that Apple spends closer to ten times as much on developing products than marketing them. Even a conservative estimate would argue they spend a reverse 4/5ths on creating and 1/5th on marketing,</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general-motors\">General Motors</h2>\n<p>How about General Motors? Not a one of these modern tech companies but still a form of technology. Well the statistics for 2017 show they spend <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/261531/general-motors-advertising-spending-in-the-us/\">$3.24 billion</a> on advertising but <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/260866/research-and-development-expenditures-of-general-motors\">$7.3 billion</a> on Research and development. That’s just over twice as much on research than marketing. Again not the four fifths dynamic that was advised.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"amazon\">Amazon</h2>\n<p>Amazon spent <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/9/1/16236506/tech-amazon-apple-gdp-spending-productivity\">$16 billion</a> on research and development last year and <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/15/amazon-spends-more-on-marketing-than-wal-mart-targ.aspx\">$7 Billion</a> on advertising in 2016. Seeing as amazon also sells products and has a movie streaming service, we could also include the <a href=\"https://businessinsider.com.pl/amazon-video-budget-in-2017-45-billion-2017-4?utm_source=businessinsider.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=redirect_businessinsider_com\">$4.5 billion</a> it spent on acquiring film rights as part of the cost of product vs marketing but regardless, Amazon also spends more on “creating” than marketing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-spend-more-time-creating-than-marketing\">Conclusion, spend more time creating than marketing</h2>\n<p>The conclusion from these companies is clear, you should spend more time creating than marketing. It’s much easier to market good products than bad ones.</p>\n",

			"title": "Good link posts vs bad link post ",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Every now and again I come across someone who is critical of this form of micro blogging. They usually argue that all link posts are bad, but personally I’ve found it to be a mixed bag with higher and lower quality. This means there must be some factors which separate good link posts and bad link posts.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, I think that a good link post is similar to a good blog post, it provides the reader with some for of value. Be that</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>entertainment</li>\n  <li>education\nor whatever, in every case you feel that you got value from that blog post/link post. In terms of link posts, I can identify three forms of value I get from good link posts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-discovery-via-one-link-post\">1. Discovery via one link post</h2>\n<p>This is where a link is shared and it leads me to an article I wouldn’t have read before. In a situation like this, simply sharing the link on social media might have the same effect but the link post usually makes it stand out more in my RSS feed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-discovery-via-the-hive-mind\">2. Discovery via the hive mind</h2>\n<p>This is where a link is shared once and it passes me by, perhaps the topic sounds boring or the title isn’t very descriptive/interesting. However, soon it seems that <em>everyone</em> is sharing the same links and I finally give into the pressure and try it out. In this case, it might be quote that the final person shares that makes me crack, but again it is usually the fact that something is being linked everywhere rather than how the link post actually is formatted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-commentary\">3. Commentary</h2>\n<p>The third category is where someone takes a link but goes further, they add their unique take or insight on the story. Perhaps it is their own story or whatever, regardless, the value in this case is both the original article <strong>and</strong> the additional commentary. The previous two cases have value in the curation, this last one has value in the link post. That’s why I usually try and write a link post like this, one which has some additional value or insight. That because I think there is a common trait in bad link posts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-same-old-same-old\">The same old, same old</h2>\n<p>The common trait in bad posts is that <strong>this</strong> link post has no value. Either the link doesn’t pass on value or the commentary doesn’t. Perhaps it’s because I’ve come across the article already, the article isn’t that interesting to me, or the commentary doesn’t really add anything. In this case the more the article gets linked, the worse quality usually comes with it. It’s usually the same old talking points and I’m more likely to have read it or just not be interested in it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steal-dont-copy\">Steal don’t copy</h2>\n<p>Another way to put it would be that you should steal (like an artist) and take some else’s link but not just copy it. Add</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>your own insight,</li>\n  <li>your favourite quote (and why)</li>\n  <li>an experience that was similar (or completely the opposite)</li>\n  <li>what questions you have</li>\n  <li>some related links</li>\n  <li>something else</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So basically, make sure you give value with your linking and everyone wins. Or don’t and just write for you  and you’ll be happy anyway.</p>\n",

One of my favourite points he makes is that the names of places and their languages get more exotic the further you go from The Shire. Bree was influence by Welsh, Gondor and Rohan by Scotland and Ireland, Dwarvish has gramatically characteristics similar to Arabic and Hebrew, The East by Turkish and Hungarian languages which were associated with invaders. So basically the languages inform how you perceive those places.</p>\n",

I had been concerned that I wouldn’t be able to fall a sleep but soon my heavy eyes shut for four hours or so till my morning alarm reopened them.</p>\n\n<p>Four hours earlier my baby girl left her hiding place and entered the world.

It’s certainly made me reevaluate many of the things I’ve been doing. Many of them just don’t see important in the grand scheme of things now, others seem more fun.

I started drawing and again reached the end after about five variations. I was about to call it quits with a warm glow on my face when I suddenly realised. <em>“Vertical lines can be hair!”</em></p>\n\n<p>Suddenly a whole host of new options were open to me as hair, then beards and more facial hair became a possibility. Then I realised ears could be shown with vertical lines and even piercings. I had given up to easily and almost missed out on a whole world of extra possibilities by not spending more time thinking and experimenting.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously drawing a face with just vertical lines isn’t exactly a revolution or really something any of us will need to do on a day to day basis but it was fun and the main lesson —to not give up easily and keep exploring an idea — is very useful for everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>*I believe this idea was a synthesis of practicing faces based of Activities from <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Rohdesign\">@Rohdesign</a> and <a href=\"http://austinkleon.com\">Austin Kleon</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/19dbf43d8f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"372\" /><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/a820c99a7e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"201\" /><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/3812ca518f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" /><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/b693a80639.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n",
