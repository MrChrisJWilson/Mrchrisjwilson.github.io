			"content_html": "<p>Yesterday I heard someone mention that their iPhone had shut down because it had got below zero Celsius (32 something Fahrenheit apparently). As someone who lives in a country where winter is often below zero (it‚Äôs minus 7 celsius as I type), I know this pain. Generally I cope by putting my iPhone in my inner pocket so it is kept warm and relying on my apple watch or AirPods for interactions with the phone. But there‚Äôs a huge issue when it comes to taking photos. \nI love photography and have far to many camera really, but there is something fun about the iPhone camera. I‚Äôve been trying to use it more recently and play with its limits and strengths but the cold weather has put a stop to those plans. Literally. \nSo today I was looking for some advice on how to shoot photos with your iPhone in winter‚Ä¶So far I haven‚Äôt found any useful advice so I have an idea that <em>just might work.</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"hand-warmers\">Hand Warmers</h2>\n<p>Yup, you know those little chemical hand warmers which you can ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù by heating them up again. In theory holding a small one next to the back of the iPhone while I have it out of my pocket should help to keep it warm <em>and</em> should also help when it‚Äôs in my pocket. \nOf course, other sides will be exposed to the elements but this is better than nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I‚Äôm going to give it a go and report back on my success/not but I wonder <strong>Do you have any tips for keeping your iPhone alive in the cold?</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/3943aaea84.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I saw someone dismissing the possibility of verso taking Facebook on. They pointed out the failure of</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>app.net</li>\n  <li>Ello</li>\n  <li>peach</li>\n  <li>and mastodon</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>While there‚Äôs validity in pointing out these failures. It‚Äôs not the full story. In fact there are three other networks that would be better to discuss.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>WhatsApp</li>\n  <li>instagram</li>\n  <li>snapchat</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Two of which Facebook bought to avoid being surpassed by (and instagram looks like the best deal they did) and one, snapchat, they have tried to kill by adding its core features to other apps. It‚Äôs important to note the difference between the apps mentioned first and these examples. Clearly Facebook precieved these apps to be a potential threat, where they didn‚Äôt view the others as threats.</p>\n\n<p>The common thread with most of these services is that they rise when Facebook is facing difficulties. These have been privacy issues (ello) and dramatic changes in design (I.e. the newsfeed). These alternatives offer more privacy and a more familiar look. But verso isn‚Äôt in that same category, it actually fits the type of situation of instagram and snap. That is a mobile first app with some unique touches and interactions. \nThis is where Facebook has always been worse and instagram is currently facing criticism for its changes to a curated newsfeed not in chronological order and full of ads. Verso offers an alternative to that.</p>\n\n<p>Now this doesn‚Äôt mean Facebook is done and so far Facebook has done a good job at reacting to challenges, but if they try and replicate the snapchat reaction, they could confuse their interface more which is part of there current issues that have helped this challenger rise.</p>\n\n<p>So I don‚Äôt think verso should be instantly dismissed or instantly thought of as a success. It will be interesting to watch.</p>\n",
