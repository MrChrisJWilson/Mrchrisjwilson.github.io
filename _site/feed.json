			"content_html": "<p>I remember hearing Merlin Mann make this statement on back to work some five years ago or so. At the time I nodded my head in agreement, but recently I‚Äôve been questioning this statement a bit.</p>\n\n<p>I initially accepted it as that had been my response with every podcast I listened to, I found them from the topic, but I stayed because I enjoyed the hosts views and the way they talked. In fact, I suspect one of my favorite podcasts of all time had a lot to do with the wonderful timbre of the main host‚Äôs voice. As further proof I could point to podcasts where I had tried but stopped listening to because I didn‚Äôt enjoy the hosts, and Bionic/bonanza which started as an android podcast but descended (well really ascended) into a podcast about secret volcano bases, Elon Musk‚Äôs plans to take over the world, round the world races and saved by the bell.</p>\n\n<p>But lately I have counter points. Podcasts where I enjoy the hosts (as I have/do listen to their other podcasts), but they have moved away from the original topic and so it no longer appeals to me. Or another podcast where I enjoyed these hosts talking about this topic but now they‚Äôve moved into a more generic topic, they don‚Äôt seem to be as interesting or original.</p>\n\n<p>While I think Merlin‚Äôs statement is a great generalization, I now believe a great podcast is a combination of many factors including the topic, the hosts perspectives and views, their interaction off each other and technical factors like good sound recording.</p>\n",

I can divide my life into the disorganized forgetful mess I was before I had my first notebook, and the increasingly organizing and effective person I am still becoming since then.</p>\n\n<p>When I went looking to get my first smartphone, the one feature I wanted was a good calendar so I could replace my paper one. I didn‚Äôt care about any games or the camera, they were of far lesser importance than the calendar and notes. To this day, my calendar, task manager and notes app are in my top five most used apps (the camera and podcast app are also present).</p>\n\n<p>But despite the usefulness of these applications, there‚Äôs still something delightful about paper and pen. The blank page is a creative curse, but it can also be an inspiring invitation.</p>\n\n<p>A blank page can become a picture, a task list, a quick doodle for no reason, a profound quote to be remembered, or a brain dump of ideas and concerns regarding a project.</p>\n\n<p>As great as my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are, they aren‚Äôt the same as a good pen and notebook.</p>\n",
