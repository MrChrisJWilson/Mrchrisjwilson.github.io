			"title": "A Long-Term Review of The Focus Course",
			
			"content_html": "<blockquote>\n  <p>“The Focus Course helped me create a manageable plan of action that worked with my work and lifestyle that I could easily implement.”</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Me</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I noticed the Focus Course had reopened today and my testimonial (the one above from being one of the initial beta testers) is still there. This made me reflect on the course and what has changed since then.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>I’ve got married</li>\n  <li>I bought a home</li>\n  <li>I welcomed my daughter into the world</li>\n  <li>and I changed job</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There’s more that’s occured of course, but these points — espeically the last point — really highlight The Focus Course’s legacy in my life. At the end of the Focus Course, I had set several core goals, I also chose a simple habit to impliment, the one which would lead to the biggest impact on my life. It was to “do a fitstar workout everyday” to help move toward my health goal. Now I go to the gym twice a week, have hit the weight goal I was aiming for (I have trouble with being underweight) and am much healthier than before.</p>\n\n<p>In work, I left my job as a teacher this summer and became a content writer. It was a long term professional goal to write for a living but one that felt so distant. Still, I kept writing. This habit with sprint targets kept me moving and eventually someone noticed. I wouldn’t have followed this path were it not for the Focus Course.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"setbacks-along-the-way\">Setbacks along the way</h2>\n<p>There have been setbacks along the way. I’ve had periods of distraction — I’ve recently noticed that I am distracted more by my phone than before — and some goals didn’t work out. I’ve tried things and changed my mind. I’ve had periods where I didn’t even check on my goals. But I can still access the Focus Course and have redone the course twice since I first took it.</p>\n\n<p>I’m about to restart the course again and I’m sure it will be different this time. For instance, I have a daughter now and this is new. Certianly some of the task will end up differently.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"you-should-do-the-focus-course\">You should do the Focus Course</h2>\n<p>The focus course isn’t cheap but it is one of the most life changing things I’ve done in my life. The method of learning is one that I’ve tired to use in learning courses I’ve set up and if you stick to it, it will make a difference.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://thefocuscourse.com/course/\">You can sign up here.</a></p>\n\n<p><em>I have no affiliate relationship with the focus course, this recommendation is just that. A heartfelt recommendation of something that will make a difference for you.</em></p>\n",

The debate in Silicon Valley now is about how much exposure to phones is O.K.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting article that touches on ideas you’ve probably heard a lot recently. I agree more with the “principled limited” screen usage. There’s an incredible depth of knowledge on the internet including things like YouTube (I don’t think there’s been a better time to learn a musical instrument and I’m brushing up my jazz guitar chops) but YouTube is designed to get you hooked and spend more time there, and often the brain dead stuff is the most addictive.

			"title": "Confession of a Recovering Productivity Addict",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Six years ago, when I was living in Spain, I was obsessed by Productivity. I tried to make my system as efficient as possible, using the best apps to help me get things done and spending hours a week listening to podcast on the topic. \nOf course, the irony was that I spent more time learning to be more productive than actually being productive. It’s easy to look down on that with hindsight as I now know many of the fundamental principles and ideas which help with productivity but back then I didn’t. At the same time, I don’t really care for listening about productivity advice (especially as an isolated topic) anymore, I know that the thing that would make the biggest difference for myself is applying what I already know, not learning something new.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-20-that-takes-you-80-of-the-way\">The 20% that takes you 80% of the way</h2>\n<p>Just like everything, there are a few core productivity principles which take you a long way. Applying those will be more beneficial than spending hours trying to learn the other 80%. Unfortunately that means doing stuff rather than sitting back and listening or reading. I’m not certain on what this 20% is exactly  – and it may well vary a bit for you – but the things that make the biggest difference for me include:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Getting a good nights sleep</li>\n  <li>Doing some regular exercise</li>\n  <li>Not eating too much bad stuff (it makes me feel tired and bloated)</li>\n  <li>Listing the key things I need to work on and do today</li>\n  <li>Writing down the steps in a project and marking the next step</li>\n  <li>If I don’t know what the next step is, thinking of whom I could ask to find out</li>\n  <li>Doing a task straight away if it will take 2 mins or less</li>\n  <li>Saving tasks as soon as I can</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"perhaps-i-needed-to-be-an-addict\">Perhaps I needed to be an addict?</h2>\n<p>I was originally going to write a bit of a rant against productivity culture where people constantly seek that extra trick (or worse app) that will help them <em>finally</em> be productive (spoiler, no matter how productive you are, you can always be more productive and even if you do reach 100% productivity, you will still wish you could do more.) but as I started writing I realized I was (partially) wrong. Those earlier experienced actually help me greatly today and just because I don’t need to hear that advice, doesn’t mean others don’t.</p>\n\n<p>Still, I wonder if most people who are concerned about being productivity would be better served spending more time <strong>doing</strong> than consuming about productivity.</p>\n",
