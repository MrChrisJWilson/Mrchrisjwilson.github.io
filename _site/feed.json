			"content_html": "<p>When I was fifteen, my dad bough me my first guitar, a Tanglewood dreadnought style acoustic. Last year I brought it over to Poland so I could play it again. I‚Äôve had it over half my life now, and it‚Äôs still going strong. It‚Äôs showing signs of age and breakdown but it will keep going and may well outlive me (even though it‚Äôs not really alive).</p>\n\n<p>I think about my guitar and other long-lasting tech when I consider most modern technology. With my recent reading of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/?tag=minima0e-20\">Perennial Seller</a> and the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2018/\">Apple event</a>, there is a lot of buzz over upgrades and the debates over what device to get. I‚Äôm looking at upgrading my phone from an iPhone SE to <em>probably</em> the iPhone X(s?). I want a smaller phone but one that has the best internals so it will keep going for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt really need this upgrade, my iPhone SE still works really well, the iOS 12 beta has made it much faster and more responsive and is like a processor upgrade, and the battery still lasts a good amount of time (and could be upgraded). Despite these factors, a new iPhone is still probably the best idea.</p>\n\n<p>My wife has my old iPhone 5s and its battery is not doing so well, in addition we have just become parents and I‚Äôd love her to be able to take live photos as well. I‚Äôm also worried that the security updates will eventual stop coming for the 5s.</p>\n\n<p>To be far to Apple, their software updates do help their devices last much longer than the average phone company, and the proliferation of battery replacement recently has helped devices last longer, still I know for sure that even the latest iPhone won‚Äôt outlast me.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I bought an old hassleblad 500cm, a medium format film camera. It‚Äôs from the year I was born and it‚Äôs going strong. I can bet it will still be going strong in 30 years time.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Another idea from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/?tag=minima0e-20\"><strong>perennial seller</strong> by Ryan Holiday</a>, ideas are cheap, executing really matters. So many people have a <em>‚Äúgreat idea for a book‚Äù</em> but a tiny fraction of those people actually even start writing (and then an even smaller fraction finish. It‚Äôs completely true and one of the key changes I made in my early twenties was moving from having ideas to trying out ideas. Later in my twenties I started getting better at finishing those same ideas and not just starting a whole host of new ones. However, that is <em>still</em> a skill I need to develop.</p>\n\n<p>I did think of <a href=\"https://jamesaltucher.com/2018/08/3-habits-transform-life/\">James Altchure‚Äôs idea factory habit (habit two)</a>. He seeks to be a constantly thinking of ideas <strong>AND</strong> reviewing them to only take action on the best ones. While ideas are cheap, we also need ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I remembered <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9OuG2b7V2sU\">Dan Aierly who described how people want to be given credit for their ideas more than the actions they take.</a> I can certainly relate and I believe that‚Äôs related to why the statement that ‚Äúideas are cheap‚Äù is so tough to stomach. We want recognition for our ideas, we believe they are valuable, but in reality no one rewards you just for ideas, they reward people for carrying out their ideas.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/e77708e0a1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôm listening to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/\"><em>‚Äùperennial seller‚Äù</em> by Ryan Holiday</a> and early on he takes aim at this truism that‚Äôs been going around. spend 1/5th of your time creating and 4/5ths promoting. He said it sounds good but really if your products not up to snuff then you‚Äôre trying to generate interest in something which doesn‚Äôt matter. (Being cynical it could well be that the type of business advisor who passes on this advice knows that their audiences products aren‚Äôt that good).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I was curious what the biggest companies ad spend to research budget was and if this might inform a better principle/ demonstrate that the 4/5th marketing idea was wrong. So what better place to start than Apple.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apple-ad-spend-to-rnd\">Apple ad Spend to RnD</h2>\n<p>Apple‚Äôs ad spend is now not widely revealed and bundled in with its administrative costs. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs under 10% of its expenses and so it isn‚Äôt necessary to disclose. The last available figure is from 2015 when it was $1.8 billion. Pretty high, but how did RnD compare in 2015? In fact, in 2015 RnD budget rose by $1.5 billion to aproximaately $5.9 billion. And in 2017 there was a $10 billion RnD spend target. So it‚Äôs possible that Apple spends closer to ten times as much on developing products than marketing them. Even a conservative estimate would argue they spend a reverse 4/5ths on creating and 1/5th on marketing,</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general-motors\">General Motors</h2>\n<p>How about General Motors? Not a one of these modern tech companies but still a form of technology. Well the statistics for 2017 show they spend <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/261531/general-motors-advertising-spending-in-the-us/\">$3.24 billion</a> on advertising but <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/260866/research-and-development-expenditures-of-general-motors\">$7.3 billion</a> on Research and development. That‚Äôs just over twice as much on research than marketing. Again not the four fifths dynamic that was advised.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"amazon\">Amazon</h2>\n<p>Amazon spent <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/9/1/16236506/tech-amazon-apple-gdp-spending-productivity\">$16 billion</a> on research and development last year and <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/15/amazon-spends-more-on-marketing-than-wal-mart-targ.aspx\">$7 Billion</a> on advertising in 2016. Seeing as amazon also sells products and has a movie streaming service, we could also include the <a href=\"https://businessinsider.com.pl/amazon-video-budget-in-2017-45-billion-2017-4?utm_source=businessinsider.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=redirect_businessinsider_com\">$4.5 billion</a> it spent on acquiring film rights as part of the cost of product vs marketing but regardless, Amazon also spends more on ‚Äúcreating‚Äù than marketing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-spend-more-time-creating-than-marketing\">Conclusion, spend more time creating than marketing</h2>\n<p>The conclusion from these companies is clear, you should spend more time creating than marketing. It‚Äôs much easier to market good products than bad ones.</p>\n",

			"title": "Good link posts vs bad link post ",
			
			"content_html": "<p>Every now and again I come across someone who is critical of this form of micro blogging. They usually argue that all link posts are bad, but personally I‚Äôve found it to be a mixed bag with higher and lower quality. This means there must be some factors which separate good link posts and bad link posts.</p>\n\n<p>In truth, I think that a good link post is similar to a good blog post, it provides the reader with some for of value. Be that</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>entertainment</li>\n  <li>education\nor whatever, in every case you feel that you got value from that blog post/link post. In terms of link posts, I can identify three forms of value I get from good link posts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-discovery-via-one-link-post\">1. Discovery via one link post</h2>\n<p>This is where a link is shared and it leads me to an article I wouldn‚Äôt have read before. In a situation like this, simply sharing the link on social media might have the same effect but the link post usually makes it stand out more in my RSS feed.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-discovery-via-the-hive-mind\">2. Discovery via the hive mind</h2>\n<p>This is where a link is shared once and it passes me by, perhaps the topic sounds boring or the title isn‚Äôt very descriptive/interesting. However, soon it seems that <em>everyone</em> is sharing the same links and I finally give into the pressure and try it out. In this case, it might be quote that the final person shares that makes me crack, but again it is usually the fact that something is being linked everywhere rather than how the link post actually is formatted.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-commentary\">3. Commentary</h2>\n<p>The third category is where someone takes a link but goes further, they add their unique take or insight on the story. Perhaps it is their own story or whatever, regardless, the value in this case is both the original article <strong>and</strong> the additional commentary. The previous two cases have value in the curation, this last one has value in the link post. That‚Äôs why I usually try and write a link post like this, one which has some additional value or insight. That because I think there is a common trait in bad link posts.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-same-old-same-old\">The same old, same old</h2>\n<p>The common trait in bad posts is that <strong>this</strong> link post has no value. Either the link doesn‚Äôt pass on value or the commentary doesn‚Äôt. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôve come across the article already, the article isn‚Äôt that interesting to me, or the commentary doesn‚Äôt really add anything. In this case the more the article gets linked, the worse quality usually comes with it. It‚Äôs usually the same old talking points and I‚Äôm more likely to have read it or just not be interested in it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steal-dont-copy\">Steal don‚Äôt copy</h2>\n<p>Another way to put it would be that you should steal (like an artist) and take some else‚Äôs link but not just copy it. Add</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>your own insight,</li>\n  <li>your favourite quote (and why)</li>\n  <li>an experience that was similar (or completely the opposite)</li>\n  <li>what questions you have</li>\n  <li>some related links</li>\n  <li>something else</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So basically, make sure you give value with your linking and everyone wins. Or don‚Äôt and just write for you  and you‚Äôll be happy anyway.</p>\n",

One of my favourite points he makes is that the names of places and their languages get more exotic the further you go from The Shire. Bree was influence by Welsh, Gondor and Rohan by Scotland and Ireland, Dwarvish has gramatically characteristics similar to Arabic and Hebrew, The East by Turkish and Hungarian languages which were associated with invaders. So basically the languages inform how you perceive those places.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Yesterday evening I suddenly had a random idea*, <em>could I draw a face with just vertical lines?</em> I grabbed my iPad and Apple pencil and gave it a go to find out that I could indeed draw a face with just verticals lines.</p>\n\n<p>I tried a few combinations and the decided I had gone as far as I could do I‚Äôd try horizontal lines to see the difference. I started drawing and again reached the end after about five variations. I was about to call it quits with a warm glow on my face when I suddenly realised. <em>‚ÄúVertical lines can be hair!‚Äù</em></p>\n\n<p>Suddenly a whole host of new options were open to me as hair, then beards and more facial hair became a possibility. Then I realised ears could be shown with vertical lines and even piercings. I had given up to easily and almost missed out on a whole world of extra possibilities by not spending more time thinking and experimenting.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously drawing a face with just vertical lines isn‚Äôt exactly a revolution or really something any of us will need to do on a day to day basis but it was fun and the main lesson ‚Äîto not give up easily and keep exploring an idea ‚Äî is very useful for everyday life.</p>\n\n<p>*I believe this idea was a synthesis of practicing faces based of Activities from <a href=\"https://micro.blog/Rohdesign\">@Rohdesign</a> and <a href=\"http://austinkleon.com\">Austin Kleon</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/19dbf43d8f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"372\" /><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/a820c99a7e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"201\" /><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/3812ca518f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"306\" /><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/b693a80639.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p>\n",
