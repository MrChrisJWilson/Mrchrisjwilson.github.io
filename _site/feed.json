			"title": "On Writing Your Job on Your About Page",
			
			"content_html": "<p>This week I realised that I could add an about page to my Micro.Blog blog and it could be longer than the mini about desciption in my Micro.blog profile (thanks <a href=\"https://micro.blog/simonwood\">@simonwood</a>). As I was writing it, I did the classic thing that I‚Äôve heard the folk at <a href=\"https://www.theminimalists.com/do/\">The minimalists podcast</a> complain about. <strong>I used my job title to describe myself</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In facts, I used my job title as my <strong>primary</strong> description of myself. This is the natural and expected course of action. When we meet someone new, one of the first few questions is usually <em>‚Äúand what do you do?‚Äù</em> which really means _‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your job?‚Äù and potentially, ‚Äúhow much do you earn and are you worth my time‚Äù.</p>\n\n<p>Well, the second part is the highly cynical take from the minimalists which I somewhat agree with. At the same time, if you do a 9-to-5 job, the chances are you spend 1/3 of your day doing that thing (then a further third sleeping) meaning you probably do spend most of your time doing your job.</p>\n\n<p>My last job was a teacher, it‚Äôs a pretty well respected thing to include in your profile. People generally think teachers are okay but not necessarily useful for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>My new job is a title I really like, <strong>‚ÄúContent Writer‚Äù</strong> which is a way to say <em>‚Äúcopywriter but we pay you less‚Äù</em> and it reflects a lot of what I like doing, researching and write. But in truth, it‚Äôs not a full representation of my character and what I do.</p>\n\n<p>So I tried a different <a href=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/about/\">About page</a> here, one that focuses on actions and personality traits I want to exhibit first rather than where my paycheck comes from. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll revisit it and update it, but it‚Äôs a start.</p>\n",

This is really not great news. I‚Äôve used Evernote for years and been a paying member for the last three. It‚Äôs not a perfect app/service, but it does the job and in the last year the company has really improved (aka, they stopped bugging me about workchat). Still, stuff like this suggests that things may not be so hot, I‚Äôd better look for an alternative and a way to move all my notes out.</p>\n",

			"title": "Thoughts on the film \"Chef\" ",
			
			"content_html": "<p>I re-watched the film with my wife over the last two days. It‚Äôs a film I‚Äôve wanted to revisit for a while but I knew I needed a bit of time. There‚Äôs a few storytelling elements that I really love in the film.</p>\n\n<p>Here‚Äôs the super short summary</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>the critic at the start of the film is right.</li>\n  <li>Carl‚Äôs relationship with his son is the most important storyline</li>\n  <li>Restoring that relationship leads to his professional success</li>\n  <li>The final crisis is all of his own creating and echos the start of the film</li>\n  <li>He ends no longer needing the critics approval.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-critic-is-right\">The critic is right.</h2>\n<p>Yeah, he‚Äôs blunt and rude with his criticism but he totally highlights Carl‚Äôs issues. He has no creative control (which Carl doesn‚Äôt realise at the start) and so his food is bland. Is he really a hater? I‚Äôve seen this online sometimes where unless someone applauds your every move, they are a hater. You can‚Äôt offer constructive criticism because any criticism means you are a hater. To be fair, the words the critic uses are attacking the character of Carl so maybe he is a hater‚Ä¶in this case.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-storyline-with-his-son-is-more-important-than-his-professional-career\">The storyline with his son is more important than his professional career</h2>\n<p>His professional career brilliantly mimics his relationship with his son (and was something I didn‚Äôt note when I first watched). At the start, he is just going through the motions with his son just as he is going through the motions at work. The difference is that he <em>wants</em> to be more creative with his work, he just can‚Äôt. With his son, he doesn‚Äôt seem to want to put in the effort because he is distracted by work.</p>\n\n<p>The low point of his career is the low point of his relationship with his son. He goes viral on the internet, loses his job and cancels his plans with his son. This is the ‚Äúdark night of the soul‚Äù moment of the film, where he is directionless and doesn‚Äôt know what to do. He has realised his problems in his last job, lack of creative control and stagnation, but he now has no options so he pushes his son away? We all know its the wrong option but it is understandable. He feels useless and doesn‚Äôt want his son to see him like this (oh hi pride).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"by-sorting-out-his-relationship-with-his-son-it-leads-to-his-work-life-improving\">By sorting out his relationship with his son, it leads to his work life improving.</h2>\n\n<p>Taking care of his son leads to him getting the idea for his food truck, he‚Äôs been presented with the idea before, but now he accepts it <strong>after</strong> his relationship is improving.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-final-crisis-is-different-from-the-typical-heros-journey\">The final crisis is different from the typical ‚ÄúHero‚Äôs journey‚Äù</h2>\n<p>The classic hero‚Äôs journey usually takes a different path, we usually have a bigger final conflict where the hero re-faces their old enemy. In Chef it is returning home. Carl starts to take the wrong path and pushes Percy away, but he changes his mind and this leads to our happy ever after ending.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"carl-no-longer-needs-the-critics-approval-but-gets-it-anyway\">Carl no longer needs the critics approval, but gets it anyway</h2>\n<p>This including the critic who tells Carl that he‚Äôs back on track. The best touch of this is that Carl no longer cares about the critic, he doesn‚Äôt <em>need</em> to impress the critic unlike the start of the film where he is dependent on his review. \nIt helps to show his progress, but it isn‚Äôt as dramatic as the classic hero‚Äôs journey and facing the emperor on the death star.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"useful-storytelling-ideas\">Useful storytelling ideas</h2>\n<p>I really like the storytelling devices that Chef uses, some of the shots are great too. It‚Äôs not a high stakes thriller but it is a great feel good film.</p>\n\n",

			"content_html": "<p>When I was fifteen, my dad bough me my first guitar, a Tanglewood dreadnought style acoustic. Last year I brought it over to Poland so I could play it again. I‚Äôve had it over half my life now, and it‚Äôs still going strong. It‚Äôs showing signs of age and breakdown but it will keep going and may well outlive me (even though it‚Äôs not really alive).</p>\n\n<p>I think about my guitar and other long-lasting tech when I consider most modern technology. With my recent reading of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/?tag=minima0e-20\">Perennial Seller</a> and the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2018/\">Apple event</a>, there is a lot of buzz over upgrades and the debates over what device to get. I‚Äôm looking at upgrading my phone from an iPhone SE to <em>probably</em> the iPhone X(s?). I want a smaller phone but one that has the best internals so it will keep going for a while.</p>\n\n<p>I don‚Äôt really need this upgrade, my iPhone SE still works really well, the iOS 12 beta has made it much faster and more responsive and is like a processor upgrade, and the battery still lasts a good amount of time (and could be upgraded). Despite these factors, a new iPhone is still probably the best idea.</p>\n\n<p>My wife has my old iPhone 5s and its battery is not doing so well, in addition we have just become parents and I‚Äôd love her to be able to take live photos as well. I‚Äôm also worried that the security updates will eventual stop coming for the 5s.</p>\n\n<p>To be far to Apple, their software updates do help their devices last much longer than the average phone company, and the proliferation of battery replacement recently has helped devices last longer, still I know for sure that even the latest iPhone won‚Äôt outlast me.</p>\n\n<p>Last year I bought an old hassleblad 500cm, a medium format film camera. It‚Äôs from the year I was born and it‚Äôs going strong. I can bet it will still be going strong in 30 years time.</p>\n",

Later in my twenties I started getting better at finishing those same ideas and not just starting a whole host of new ones. However, that is <em>still</em> a skill I need to develop.</p>\n\n<p>I did think of <a href=\"https://jamesaltucher.com/2018/08/3-habits-transform-life/\">James Altchure‚Äôs idea factory habit (habit two)</a>. He seeks to be a constantly thinking of ideas <strong>AND</strong> reviewing them to only take action on the best ones. While ideas are cheap, we also need ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I remembered <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9OuG2b7V2sU\">Dan Aierly who described how people want to be given credit for their ideas more than the actions they take.</a> I can certainly relate and I believe that‚Äôs related to why the statement that ‚Äúideas are cheap‚Äù is so tough to stomach. We want recognition for our ideas, we believe they are valuable, but in reality no one rewards you just for ideas, they reward people for carrying out their ideas.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/e77708e0a1.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n",

			"title": "No, you shouldn't spend 4/5th of your time marketing and 1/5th creating",
			
			"content_html": "<p>I‚Äôm listening to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/\"><em>‚Äùperennial seller‚Äù</em> by Ryan Holiday</a> and early on he takes aim at this truism that‚Äôs been going around. spend 1/5th of your time creating and 4/5ths promoting. He said it sounds good but really if your products not up to snuff then you‚Äôre trying to generate interest in something which doesn‚Äôt matter. (Being cynical it could well be that the type of business advisor who passes on this advice knows that their audiences products aren‚Äôt that good).</p>\n\n<p>Anyway I was curious what the biggest companies ad spend to research budget was and if this might inform a better principle/ demonstrate that the 4/5th marketing idea was wrong. So what better place to start than Apple.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"apple-ad-spend-to-rnd\">Apple ad Spend to RnD</h2>\n<p>Apple‚Äôs ad spend is now not widely revealed and bundled in with its administrative costs. That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs under 10% of its expenses and so it isn‚Äôt necessary to disclose. The last available figure is from 2015 when it was $1.8 billion. Pretty high, but how did RnD compare in 2015? In fact, in 2015 RnD budget rose by $1.5 billion to aproximaately $5.9 billion. And in 2017 there was a $10 billion RnD spend target. So it‚Äôs possible that Apple spends closer to ten times as much on developing products than marketing them. Even a conservative estimate would argue they spend a reverse 4/5ths on creating and 1/5th on marketing,</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"general-motors\">General Motors</h2>\n<p>How about General Motors? Not a one of these modern tech companies but still a form of technology. Well the statistics for 2017 show they spend <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/261531/general-motors-advertising-spending-in-the-us/\">$3.24 billion</a> on advertising but <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/260866/research-and-development-expenditures-of-general-motors\">$7.3 billion</a> on Research and development. That‚Äôs just over twice as much on research than marketing. Again not the four fifths dynamic that was advised.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"amazon\">Amazon</h2>\n<p>Amazon spent <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/9/1/16236506/tech-amazon-apple-gdp-spending-productivity\">$16 billion</a> on research and development last year and <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/15/amazon-spends-more-on-marketing-than-wal-mart-targ.aspx\">$7 Billion</a> on advertising in 2016. Seeing as amazon also sells products and has a movie streaming service, we could also include the <a href=\"https://businessinsider.com.pl/amazon-video-budget-in-2017-45-billion-2017-4?utm_source=businessinsider.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=redirect_businessinsider_com\">$4.5 billion</a> it spent on acquiring film rights as part of the cost of product vs marketing but regardless, Amazon also spends more on ‚Äúcreating‚Äù than marketing.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion-spend-more-time-creating-than-marketing\">Conclusion, spend more time creating than marketing</h2>\n<p>The conclusion from these companies is clear, you should spend more time creating than marketing. It‚Äôs much easier to market good products than bad ones.</p>\n",
