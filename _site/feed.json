			"content_html": "<p>One of the things that annoys me the most about the modern internet landscape is how much stuff is made about making stuff. Especially when it is the same form as the thing which is being made.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Blog posts about writing blog posts</li>\n  <li>Youtube Videos about making YouTube videos</li>\n  <li>Podcasts about podcasts (this is probably the least offender)\nI now wonder if this is part of the inherit nature of being an indie creator. If you become successful and go full time, then the thing you are making becomes your full time job. What else can you write about…except writing about running your job.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Of course, <strong>it’s not inevitable</strong> and I think the <strong>best</strong> online content avoids this pitfall. CGP Grey’s great videos aren’t about how he makes his videos, Amanda Palmer’s music isn’t about making music and Andy Weir wrote a great book about a man on mars on his blog.</p>\n\n<p>My challenge to myself is to focus more on making things, and not making things about making things.</p>\n\n",

As a result, parents who are busy, distracted or can’t afford to spend as much 1:1 time as they’d like are unknowingly encouraging their kids to become digital zombies, with a constant need for stimulation, who are being manipulated by digital overlords to click and click some more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the past in Europe, pale skin was seen as attractive, as people who were suntanned worked in the fields. Now, the reverse is true as it is a sign of not working to have travel abroad and obtained your tan. This digital situation reminds me of getting tanned, the element which distinguished you in the past was access to the internet, now it is being able to disconnect.</p>\n\n<p>Also see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455586692/?tag=minima0e-20\">Deep Work by Cal Newport</a> (affiliate link)</p>\n",
