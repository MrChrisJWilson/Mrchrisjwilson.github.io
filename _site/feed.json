Of course I also weighted the profile who was recommending this post into my equation.</p>\n\n<p>I am incredibly thankful that microblog hasn‚Äôt descended into linkpost, clickbait and their ilk butit doesn‚Äôt change the fact that headlines and titles are still one of, if not <strong>the</strong> key factor in me choosing to read a post or not.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>After a session at the <a href=\"https://sketchnotecamp.wordpress.com\">International Sketchnote camp in Lisbon</a> today I felt challenged and excited to share more of my sketchnoting online. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve resisted doing because I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm as good as others and I know that there are sometimes mistakes in my sketchnotes: crooked lines, spelling, running out of space. I was, however, reminded of the value of <strong>sharing your work</strong> as you go along and that, in reality, the process is what is really of value not the product.</p>\n\n<p>But how could I start? What step would be the easiest to get me to share more of my sketchnotes.</p>\n\n<p>The first step.</p>\n\n<p>In my case, this would be <strong>taking the photo of the sketchnote to share</strong>. If I don‚Äôt take the picture, I‚Äôve got nothing to share. Once I‚Äôve taken the photo then I‚Äôve got something to share and it‚Äôs fairly simple to type out a note and share the sketchnote from there. But taking the photo is a hanging point for me. I often don‚Äôt take my phone out, and when it is I forget to/ resist take the photos.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, even if I don‚Äôt share a sketchnote after photographing it, immediately or after a wait, I still have the sketchnote save and more available to share.</p>\n\n<p>I think this applied to many other areas. Just doing the first step can get the process going.</p>\n\n",
