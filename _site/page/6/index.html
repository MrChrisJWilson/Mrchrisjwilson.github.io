  <p>Cross linking between blogs has nearly dried up. It‚Äôs almost impossible to find new opinions because everyone links to the same three websites, like I‚Äôm doing now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of voices have moved on to podcasting. Frankly, as someone that also podcasts, it‚Äôs easier and there‚Äôs less accountability than with blogging. Today, I also see a lot of thoughtful people writing on Discord groups. There‚Äôs little value in blogging unless you just like to practice writing in public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is one of those articles that starts discussing one issue, but the commentary actually is far more interesting than the inital discussion (In my opinion at least). I wonder how accurate Gabe‚Äôs prognosis is (that new voices are podcasting). While I see truth in this, I also think one of the issues is that online writing has become quite formulaic and people simply copy others ideas without offering something fresh. 
No one could be a full time blogger in the early days of online writing, now there are a host of them (and companies that employ writers) who‚Äôs opinions are well regarded. I‚Äôve started (and stopped) following some new writers as I realised they were just repeating others points. At the same time, I have discovered fresh voices who offer something unique.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://rosemaryorchard.com/">Rose Orchard</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://beardyguycreative.com/blog/">Denny Henke</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.gr36.com/">Greg Morris</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://thedent.net/">Andy Nicolaides</a>
Admittedly some of those same voices also use their litteral voices for podcasts too, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that they are adding their unique writing voice. Really, it‚Äôs not that writing is in decline, it‚Äôs that more writers are also professional podcasters.</li>

  <p>Of those creators, only 1,393 ‚Äî 2 percent ‚Äî make the equivalent of federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, or $1,160 a month, in October 2017. Worse, if we change it to $15 per hour, a minimum wage slowly being adopted by states, that‚Äôs only .8 percent of all creators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of depressing reading as it casts a lot of doubt on pateron and donations as long term viable income streams. At the same time, it‚Äôs not the <em>most</em> suprising statistic and seems to refect common distribution curves where the top far out performs the majority.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Last month I tried updating my <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/now/">Now page</a> at the start of the month and <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/10/01/now-and-then.html">writing a description of what had occurred</a>, and what is coming up. It‚Äôs kind of a ‚Äúmonthly review‚Äù for me.</p>

<p>So here‚Äôs my November 2018 Now and Then Update</p>

<h2 id="then">Then</h2>

<p><strong>Goals</strong>
My goals for last month were a mixed bag
 Spend time with my daughter</p>
<ul>
  <li>I caught up with the copyblogger course I‚Äôm doing and now just need to submit some work.</li>
  <li>I did nothing for ‚Äúthe ninja project‚Äù and it‚Äôs probably on the back burner unfortunately.</li>
  <li>I read very little more of On Writing Well but I did read some. I‚Äôm hoping to slowly continue this month</li>
  <li>I did try a couple of calligraphy styles, but the main thing I did was investigate the Pentel brush pen by doing Inktober only using that pen. It was a really fun challenge to try an unusual and different pen. I kind of want to do something similar with a different pen next month and see what comes up.</li>
  <li>My writing portfolio still needs a bit of an update but it‚Äôs coming along well</li>
  <li>I did nothing for NaNoWriMo but I‚Äôm going to start free writing everyday, it may lead to a book, or not. Hopefully it will stick beyond just November.</li>
  <li>I didn‚Äôt plan to, but I ended up completing Inktober and I‚Äôm going to put a micro.blog post with every image.</li>
  <li>I spent far too much time considering what new phone I should get. I had placed some limits and requirements to stop me upgrading sooner and they were now all met. However, I didn‚Äôt want to blindly follow my gut but really check and make sure I was making a good choice that reflecting a suitable use of money. At times like this I like to review why I don‚Äôt use certain products and consider what it would be like to switch system as well as the pain points. In this case I really considered getting an Android phone. There are certainly some advantages but I‚Äôve happily decided against doing so, I placed one last restriction on myself to give myself time to make sure I was happy with my final decision and so in a week or so, I should upgrade.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Events</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>My parents visited and met their Granddaughter</li>
  <li>My in-laws visited again and we prepared some great food.</li>
  <li>We went to a wedding in Lublin</li>
  <li>I had a major project at work that was a great challenge, but quite stressful.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Unexpected delights</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Starting reading Atomic Habits by James Clear</li>
  <li>Getting back in to exercising after some illness</li>
  <li>David Sparks Omnifocus field guide provided some really interesting ideas.</li>
  <li>I‚Äôve really got back into Jazz music again.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>
<p>Last time I talked about goals, this month (inspired by James Clear) I want to focus on habits instead.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Daily writing first thing (instead of browsing and searching the internet)</li>
  <li>Playing some Jazz guitar at the weekend</li>
  <li>Personalizing a couple more Siri Shortcuts so they are more useful</li>
  <li>Going through a couple of courses I signed up for in the past‚Ä¶and did nothing with!</li>
  <li>I‚Äôm looking for a better way to manage quotes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upcoming events</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>My wife‚Äôs birthday</li>
  <li>Some national holidays (1st November and 11th)</li>
</ul>

        <h2><a href="/2018/10/31/a-longterm-review.html">A Long-Term Review of The Focus Course</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThe Focus Course helped me create a manageable plan of action that worked with my work and lifestyle that I could easily implement.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Me</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I noticed the Focus Course had reopened today and my testimonial (the one above from being one of the initial beta testers) is still there. This made me reflect on the course and what has changed since then.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I‚Äôve got married</li>
  <li>I bought a home</li>
  <li>I welcomed my daughter into the world</li>
  <li>and I changed job</li>
</ul>

<p>There‚Äôs more that‚Äôs occured of course, but these points ‚Äî espeically the last point ‚Äî really highlight The Focus Course‚Äôs legacy in my life. At the end of the Focus Course, I had set several core goals, I also chose a simple habit to impliment, the one which would lead to the biggest impact on my life. It was to ‚Äúdo a fitstar workout everyday‚Äù to help move toward my health goal. Now I go to the gym twice a week, have hit the weight goal I was aiming for (I have trouble with being underweight) and am much healthier than before.</p>

<p>In work, I left my job as a teacher this summer and became a content writer. It was a long term professional goal to write for a living but one that felt so distant. Still, I kept writing. This habit with sprint targets kept me moving and eventually someone noticed. I wouldn‚Äôt have followed this path were it not for the Focus Course.</p>

<h2 id="setbacks-along-the-way">Setbacks along the way</h2>
<p>There have been setbacks along the way. I‚Äôve had periods of distraction ‚Äî I‚Äôve recently noticed that I am distracted more by my phone than before ‚Äî and some goals didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve tried things and changed my mind. I‚Äôve had periods where I didn‚Äôt even check on my goals. But I can still access the Focus Course and have redone the course twice since I first took it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm about to restart the course again and I‚Äôm sure it will be different this time. For instance, I have a daughter now and this is new. Certianly some of the task will end up differently.</p>

<h2 id="you-should-do-the-focus-course">You should do the Focus Course</h2>
<p>The focus course isn‚Äôt cheap but it is one of the most life changing things I‚Äôve done in my life. The method of learning is one that I‚Äôve tired to use in learning courses I‚Äôve set up and if you stick to it, it will make a difference.</p>

<p><em>I have no affiliate relationship with the focus course, this recommendation is just that. A heartfelt recommendation of something that will make a difference for you.</em></p>
