        <h2><a href="/2018/10/24/confession-of-a.html">Confession of a Recovering Productivity Addict</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Six years ago, when I was living in Spain, I was obsessed by Productivity. I tried to make my system as efficient as possible, using the best apps to help me get things done and spending hours a week listening to podcast on the topic. 
Of course, the irony was that I spent more time learning to be more productive than actually being productive. It‚Äôs easy to look down on that with hindsight as I now know many of the fundamental principles and ideas which help with productivity but back then I didn‚Äôt. At the same time, I don‚Äôt really care for listening about productivity advice (especially as an isolated topic) anymore, I know that the thing that would make the biggest difference for myself is applying what I already know, not learning something new.</p>

<h2 id="the-20-that-takes-you-80-of-the-way">The 20% that takes you 80% of the way</h2>
<p>Just like everything, there are a few core productivity principles which take you a long way. Applying those will be more beneficial than spending hours trying to learn the other 80%. Unfortunately that means doing stuff rather than sitting back and listening or reading. I‚Äôm not certain on what this 20% is exactly  ‚Äì and it may well vary a bit for you ‚Äì but the things that make the biggest difference for me include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting a good nights sleep</li>
  <li>Doing some regular exercise</li>
  <li>Not eating too much bad stuff (it makes me feel tired and bloated)</li>
  <li>Listing the key things I need to work on and do today</li>
  <li>Writing down the steps in a project and marking the next step</li>
  <li>If I don‚Äôt know what the next step is, thinking of whom I could ask to find out</li>
  <li>Doing a task straight away if it will take 2 mins or less</li>
  <li>Saving tasks as soon as I can</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="perhaps-i-needed-to-be-an-addict">Perhaps I needed to be an addict?</h2>
<p>I was originally going to write a bit of a rant against productivity culture where people constantly seek that extra trick (or worse app) that will help them <em>finally</em> be productive (spoiler, no matter how productive you are, you can always be more productive and even if you do reach 100% productivity, you will still wish you could do more.) but as I started writing I realized I was (partially) wrong. Those earlier experienced actually help me greatly today and just because I don‚Äôt need to hear that advice, doesn‚Äôt mean others don‚Äôt.</p>

<p>Still, I wonder if most people who are concerned about being productivity would be better served spending more time <strong>doing</strong> than consuming about productivity.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/10/22/you-dont-need.html">You Don‚Äôt Need to Do ‚ÄúReal Work‚Äù on the iPad, Just Normal Work</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>One of the ideas that get‚Äôs branded about when we talk about the iPad is that you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt do real work on the iPad‚Äù. I used to debate this topic a lot but today I realised that it‚Äôs complete rubbish. Not because you can do everything on the iPad, but actually it‚Äôs not that important and distracts from the issue that is really important. Let me explain.</p>

<h2 id="the-cant-do-real-work-narrative">The Can‚Äôt Do Real Work Narrative</h2>
<p>The can‚Äôt do real work narrative works so well for two reasons, there are people who propose it and then there are those of us stupid enough to spend time debating it. Sure, it‚Äôs a fun question and topic to debate but the conclusion that is put forward ‚Äî tablets suck, they aren‚Äôt the future of computing etc ‚Äî isn‚Äôt dependent on that statement.</p>

<p>So a brief summary of the debate. Real work usually means programming or graphic design work, or occasionally working with some complicated CMS system (because tech writers) it includes <strong>every</strong> professional task someone needs to do (even if they do it rarely). Under these conditions you can‚Äôt do ‚Äúreal work‚Äù but in truth things are getting better all the time, there are interesting hacks around these issue which can be better than traditional solutions and <strong>not everyone needs to do these tasks.</strong></p>

<h2 id="not-everyone-needs-to-do-these-tasks">Not everyone needs to do these tasks</h2>
<p>This last point has become increasingly resonate within my own life. I changed from teaching to being a content writer. My day now looks like most typical corporate jobs instead of a life of traveling from location to location, creating handouts and presentations and other more unique challenges.</p>

<p>In my last job, there were some of these classic ‚Äúreal work‚Äù tasks that I found difficult: designing graphics, making videos, web design.</p>

<p>In my new job, I have the problems that most people suffer at work and let me tell you, you don‚Äôt need powerful programs like photoshop on the iPad to solve those problems.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-problems-people-face-with-real-work">The Real problems people face with real work</h2>
<p>With software, there are a few core programs that I require, many of which have basic iPad apps that lack essential functionality. There are also a few websites and programs which just aren‚Äôt compatible.</p>

<p>With hardware, the idea of using my iPad at a desk for hours on end just isn‚Äôt sensible. Sure I could jerry rig some system to prop it up at the correct hight, and if I attended a few more meetings then I probably would have the sedentary work life that leads to neck-ache, but I do and as such a giant external monitor on a MacBook Pro is a very welcome relief. <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/#1">1</a></p>

<p>These are issues which are rarely discussed when it comes to the iPad and real work and yet are much more pertinent for the average person. If you can‚Äôt access every webpage, then you can‚Äôt use an iPad for work. If there is some pesky item which needs to be dragged and dropped and doesn‚Äôt support touch, then you can‚Äôt use an iPad for real work. If you can‚Äôt access a common feature in a common app that your office uses, then you can‚Äôt use an iPad for real work.</p>

<h2 id="the-same-isnt-true-of-chrome-os-or-windows-10">The same isn‚Äôt true of chrome OS or Windows 10</h2>
<p>Look, there is a lot I don‚Äôt like about Chrome OS and Windows 10. They all have downsides and the tablet versions of these devices really do, but they do the basics right. You can open up either device and do what most people in an office need to do (and at home too boot).</p>

<p>The solution to the iPad‚Äôs problems for being usable at work isn‚Äôt really in pro apps like Photoshop or xcode, but it is in being able to do the last 10% of tasks that people in offices can‚Äôt do or are better with a different device.</p>

<ol>
  <li>&lt;a name=#1&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I should note that there are rumors that the latest iPad Pro will support external monitors in someway. This would be a good step forward but technically you can already do that with the lightning to HDMI output and this doesn‚Äôt really solve the issue. You still need to look at the iPad screen to touch it. Unless Mouse or touchpad support came to the iPad that is.</li>
</ol>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I was updating my now page and thought it was a shame to delete the events from last month. So I‚Äôve decided to write up a kind of ‚Äúchange log‚Äù at the start of each month reviewing the last month and highlighting what‚Äôs coming up this month. It‚Äôs a bit like a monthly review meets journal or whatever.</p>

<h2 id="then">Then</h2>
<p>My goals for last month were</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spending time with my new baby (YES!)</li>
  <li>removing and stopping old projects (stopped many, but there are more I should probably stop!)</li>
  <li>experimenting with new calligraphy styles (definitely did)</li>
  <li>Finishing ‚Äúthe ninja project‚Äù (made some progress yesterday but didn‚Äôt do much previously)</li>
  <li>regular exercise (I got ill at the end of the month and with travel meant this was not a good month)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some key events in the month were</p>
<ul>
  <li>in-laws coming to visit, thrice</li>
  <li>Going to the International Sketchnote Camp in Lisbon</li>
  <li>iOS 12 came out with shortcuts.</li>
  <li>I returned to work from paternity leave.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unexpected delights</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arbitrary stupid goal was a fun read</li>
  <li><a href="https://learn.macsparky.com/courses/">David Spark‚Äôs Siri Shortcuts</a> guide was useful</li>
  <li>On Writing Well has been a delight</li>
  <li>I got my company to pay for me to do the CopyBlogger Content Marketing Certification Course</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="now">Now</h2>

<p>This month my goals are</p>
<ul>
  <li>Spend time with my daughter</li>
  <li>Continue the Copyblogger course (and not fall behind)</li>
  <li>Finish the ‚Äúninja project‚Äù (if possible)</li>
  <li>Finish reading On Writing Well</li>
  <li>Try some new Calligraphy styles</li>
  <li>Get writing portfolio finished</li>
  <li>Preparing for NaNoWriMo</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="upcoming-events">Upcoming Events</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Parents visiting</li>
  <li>A close friend‚Äôs birthday</li>
  <li>A wedding</li>
  <li>A new product launch</li>
</ul>

        <h2><a href="/2018/09/29/autumnal.html">Autumnal </a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Autumnal may well be my favourite word in the English language. It‚Äôs partially because it has such wonderful sounds that flow smoothly into each other ‚Äì no fricatives to be found here. But it‚Äôs also because of what the word represents.</p>

<p>To me, Autumn is a time of coziness. Of warm drinks, Golden colours and beautiful sunrises and sunsets. 
Heat and energy radiate out of it at all times, be that in the mid-day sun, the new fashion items to wear or the red leaves that now lie on the ground.</p>

<p>This warmth is something I try and live out in my life, not just in this season but always.</p>
<ul>
  <li>To share what I have with those in need, and not.</li>
  <li>To be friendly even when people aren‚Äôt friendly to me (I‚Äôve found this more difficult recently)</li>
  <li>and to gather those closest to me whenever I can.</li>
</ul>

<p>Admittedly ‚ÄúFall‚Äù has some similar phonetic qualities but I can‚Äôt divorce it from its other meaning. But as a writer who focuses on an American audience I have to fall for its charms, at least superficially.</p>

<p>Deep down my heart belongs to Autumn.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>We all know the classic truism to not judge a book by its cover, and yet we continue to do so. Even if we move past the cover, the odds are we still judge the book by its title. In our world of ever closer connections and abundance of information we have to use some clue to filter the wheat from the chaff.</p>

<p>Today I found myself doing that very thing on micro.blog. As I scrolled my timeline I saw a new post and didn‚Äôt immediately click. I looked at the title, considered what it might be about and weather that would be relevant or interesting to me. Of course I also weighted the profile who was recommending this post into my equation.</p>

<p>I am incredibly thankful that microblog hasn‚Äôt descended into linkpost, clickbait and their ilk butit doesn‚Äôt change the fact that headlines and titles are still one of, if not <strong>the</strong> key factor in me choosing to read a post or not.</p>
