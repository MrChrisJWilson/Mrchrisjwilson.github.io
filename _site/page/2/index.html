      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Something I‚Äôve been wondering about. Starbucks coffee size names.</p>

<p>They are clearly influenced by Italian culture and attempt to communicate that but they are confusing so people just use large middle and small (in my experience). So it makes me wonder what could be a better system of names. Ones which reflect Italy but also are clear over the size.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Piccolo</li>
  <li>Medio</li>
  <li>Grande
I don‚Äôt think everyone would use them, but you wouldn‚Äôt have to remember that Vente is in fact the largest coffee size, not the grand grande.</li>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I remember hearing Merlin Mann make this statement on back to work some five years ago or so. At the time I nodded my head in agreement, but recently I‚Äôve been questioning this statement a bit.</p>

<p>I initially accepted it as that had been my response with every podcast I listened to, I found them from the topic, but I stayed because I enjoyed the hosts views and the way they talked. In fact, I suspect one of my favorite podcasts of all time had a lot to do with the wonderful timbre of the main host‚Äôs voice. As further proof I could point to podcasts where I had tried but stopped listening to because I didn‚Äôt enjoy the hosts, and Bionic/bonanza which started as an android podcast but descended (well really ascended) into a podcast about secret volcano bases, Elon Musk‚Äôs plans to take over the world, round the world races and saved by the bell.</p>

<p>But lately I have counter points. Podcasts where I enjoy the hosts (as I have/do listen to their other podcasts), but they have moved away from the original topic and so it no longer appeals to me. Or another podcast where I enjoyed these hosts talking about this topic but now they‚Äôve moved into a more generic topic, they don‚Äôt seem to be as interesting or original.</p>

<p>While I think Merlin‚Äôs statement is a great generalization, I now believe a great podcast is a combination of many factors including the topic, the hosts perspectives and views, their interaction off each other and technical factors like good sound recording.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p>One of my new listening habits at work is to listen to a jazz classic performed by several different people. One of the best things about Jazz is how different performers interpret and add their own flare onto a standard version. YouTube is such a great place to find these variations.</p>

<p>So here is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLykefMsqC1nda54r6js-w5tOFCc7YTCgd">playlist of variations of Georgia on my mind</a>, some more jazzy, some more bluesy, many are solo guitar pieces but some have backing tracking or a band.</p>

<p>P.s. I‚Äôve made a <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/jazz-standards/">new page where I‚Äôll collect some of these lists.</a></p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/11/24/i-still-love.html">I still love paper </a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>In many ways I think my attachment for my smartphone is born out of my same attachment for notebooks and pens. The later preceded the former when my father gifted me a translucent purple covered a6 pocket notebook at high school. 
The point was to write my tasks and assignments so I wouldn‚Äôt have to rely on my very fallible memory and instead stay organized and on top of things.</p>

<p>The reason it stuck was because I also had a set of bright neon pens that I used to reimagine the cover and pages inside.</p>

<p>Nethertheless, the notebook did it‚Äôs job and lead to a transformative moment in my life. I can divide my life into the disorganized forgetful mess I was before I had my first notebook, and the increasingly organizing and effective person I am still becoming since then.</p>

<p>When I went looking to get my first smartphone, the one feature I wanted was a good calendar so I could replace my paper one. I didn‚Äôt care about any games or the camera, they were of far lesser importance than the calendar and notes. To this day, my calendar, task manager and notes app are in my top five most used apps (the camera and podcast app are also present).</p>

<p>But despite the usefulness of these applications, there‚Äôs still something delightful about paper and pen. The blank page is a creative curse, but it can also be an inspiring invitation.</p>

<p>A blank page can become a picture, a task list, a quick doodle for no reason, a profound quote to be remembered, or a brain dump of ideas and concerns regarding a project.</p>

<p>As great as my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are, they aren‚Äôt the same as a good pen and notebook.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/11/20/the-annoying-trend.html">The Annoying Trend of Making Stuff About Making Stuff</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>One of the things that annoys me the most about the modern internet landscape is how much stuff is made about making stuff. Especially when it is the same form as the thing which is being made.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blog posts about writing blog posts</li>
  <li>Youtube Videos about making YouTube videos</li>
  <li>Podcasts about podcasts (this is probably the least offender)
I now wonder if this is part of the inherit nature of being an indie creator. If you become successful and go full time, then the thing you are making becomes your full time job. What else can you write about‚Ä¶except writing about running your job.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, <strong>it‚Äôs not inevitable</strong> and I think the <strong>best</strong> online content avoids this pitfall. CGP Grey‚Äôs great videos aren‚Äôt about how he makes his videos, Amanda Palmer‚Äôs music isn‚Äôt about making music and Andy Weir wrote a great book about a man on mars on his blog.</p>

<p>My challenge to myself is to focus more on making things, and not making things about making things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today, as digital tools get cheaper and more widespread, a new gap is appearing:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a parent uses a tablet or a smartphone as a babysitter, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get a kid to sit still. As a result, parents who are busy, distracted or can‚Äôt afford to spend as much 1:1 time as they‚Äôd like are unknowingly encouraging their kids to become digital zombies, with a constant need for stimulation, who are being manipulated by digital overlords to click and click some more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the past in Europe, pale skin was seen as attractive, as people who were suntanned worked in the fields. Now, the reverse is true as it is a sign of not working to have travel abroad and obtained your tan. This digital situation reminds me of getting tanned, the element which distinguished you in the past was access to the internet, now it is being able to disconnect.</p>
