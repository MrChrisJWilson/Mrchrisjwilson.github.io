      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I noticed something about Brain Picking’s blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>“The most regretful people on earth,”</em> Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, <em>“are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.”</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/">Walt Witman on Creativity</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an “open loop” where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everything can be taken from a man,” Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, “but one thing: the last of the human freedoms — to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/">Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, “the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.”</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/">Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita’s Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it’s a shorter quote.</p>

<p>Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.</p>

  <p>It has also been observed that if a person finds themselves engaging in activities which are in opposition to what they believe, they will be <strong>more willing to change their belief or adopt new beliefs to suit the situation, rather than change their actions.</strong></p>

<p>I’m researching for an article and this statement really struck me. People will change their beliefs to match their actions more than change their actions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I find that reading my work aloud makes it weird enough that I can’t scan or gloss over anything.
Reading to an audience is best, because you start really judging the thing when you have to project it into a room full of people. Quentin Tarantino says he likes to read his scripts to his friends, not for their feedback, but their presence. “I don’t want input, I don’t want you to tell me if I’m doing anything wrong, heavens forbid,” he says, “But I write a scene, and I think I’ve heard it as much as I can, but then when I read it to you … I hear it through your ears, and it lets me know I’m on the right track.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use this trick with proofreading texts. Sometimes I have to look at the same thing that’s been sent back and forth about five times, often with a minor change introduced that is easily missed. Reading aloud is one of the only ways to keep my eyes fresh.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/09/12/hoping-to-be.html">Hoping to Be Delighted by Apple</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Well it’s Apple iPhone event day and I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>I’m really ready for a phone upgrade, I want to pass my current phone on to my wife<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> so we can share Live Photos of my daughter, plus then she won’t have a terrible battery life. But I feel a bit nervous. <strong>I’m worried Apple won’t give me a reason to upgrade today.</strong></p>

<p>It’s a funny fear to have, that someone <strong>won’t</strong> make you want to give them money. No doubt I’ll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I’d want to upgrade but at the same time I’m really not sure where they go next with smartphones.</p>

<p>Personally, I’m intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn’t seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.</p>

<p>Regardless, I’ll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don’t see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.</p>

        <p>I was trying to write an article and it just <em>wasn’t</em> coming. The ideas were all jumbled and the thought wasn’t clear or refined. So I finished, and then <em>“published”</em> to DayOne. I love having a place to send writing that isn’t online for things which are too private or incomplete.</p>

        <p>I made this sketch in my commonplace book about a week and a half ago and since then this idea has come up a few times for me (including the latest Episode of <a href="http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/108">Hello Internet </a>. That’s usually a sign to take notice of an idea, when it keeps coming up. It’s also part of the value of a commonplace book, you can notice the themes and ideas that come up again and again and see patterns and connections emerging over time.</p>

<p>Attention is one of our most valuable resources and yet nowadays it feels like it’s given away for so little. Even giving away your Email address for some freebie is an invitation to take some of your attention.</p>

<p>I’ve made a few changes recently to try and protect my attention more but I know that I both don’t stick to all of those changes and they don’t go far enough.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focusing on longer and deeper content</li>
  <li>planning silence</li>
  <li>limiting disctration time</li>
</ul>

<p>They’ve all helped but the issue persists. Today I disabled some more notifications, removed another couple of podcasts from my app and finally set some limits in the new screen time settings in iOS 12. I hope they’ll help, but I know the attitude is the most important step.</p>

<p>I’d never heard of Thai rolls before but it’s a type of ice cream that basically gets made in front of your eyes. We went for kinder bueno with coconut pieces. Pretty tasty.</p>
