<blockquote>
  <p>When you mention time and attention theft, most creators think of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (which I call Facebook II). They usually don‚Äôt think about Youtube or podcasts, which have the same issues: the ad model and all its abuses to the listener, and the lack of quality in favor of burn-out-inducing ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù and quantity (something that is also tied to the ad model).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recently cut the number of podcast I listen to for similar reasons. With exceptions, podcast tend towards entertainment over content. I don‚Äôt think there is anything inherently wrong with that. <strong>It‚Äôs good to switch off and be entertained from time to time but not all the time.</strong>
Still greater intentionality is always good, as is <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/09/09/protect-your-attention.html">protecting your attention</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/emulsify-camera/id1408272207?mt=8">Emulsify Camera</a></p>

<p>I‚Äôve tested this app by <a href="https://micro.blog/sharding">@sharding</a> for a couple of weeks and it‚Äôs not like your typical iPhone camera app. It isn‚Äôt feature rich but it has strong opinions. It is influenced by the classic experience of shooting black and white film, with two iconic film simulations, but does so in a non typical way. Most camera apps aim to show you want you are going to see in the end result, Emulsify recreates the unpredictability of film in that you see things in colour before getting your Black and white results. This means you have to train your eye a bit to think about shades and tone and not just colour differences. 
It‚Äôs a very different camera app experience that I suspect some won‚Äôt like, but personally I‚Äôm hooked. That‚Äôs perhaps less surprising considering the amount of black and white film I‚Äôve been burning through recently. Now I just need to get a new iPhone to test the camera on that‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶to help Sean.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I just think one of the main reasons that the internet took off like it did from the late‚Äì90s onward was that people could finally have a voice, regardless of whether or not that voice drove clicks and views. No need to go through gatekeepers like print publications, book publishers, etc‚Ä¶ we could just write something and hit publish. Now our voices are collectively passed through the values of content marketing and growth-hacking.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I probably could have linked to Paul‚Äôs whole article but what‚Äôs the point in that. So instead I quoted the part I found most inspiring. It‚Äôs a really great take on the difference between blogging and content marketing. This hit me hard as I‚Äôve done a lot of ‚Äúcontentting‚Äù and not that much blogging until I came on Micro.blog‚Ä¶it‚Äôs good to be blogging.</p>

      <section class="post-body">
        <p><a href="https://kenrockwell.com/tech/fart.htm">Fart for better photos</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I take my best pictures when I FART first.
FARTing helps us remember to make a strong, meaningful photo instead of just snapping away and winding up with a lot of boring, thoughtless snapshots.
FART is a mnemonic for a creative process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ken Rockwell is not the best photographer in the world and some people really disagree with him on some aspects of photography but this little mnemonic is great photography advice for everyone. I love starting here rathe than ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù or whatever because all of those composition rules can be broken.</p>

<p>I thought of this post as I had seen that <a href="https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/finally-a-photography-101-course-i-can-recommend">CJ Chilvers had written in support</a> of the upcoming <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/capturing-a-great-photo-on-iphone/">The Sweet Setup Photo course</a>.
Honestly, when they announced they were making photo course I was worried. The feel I usually get from tech journalists who write photo advice focus more on the tech side of photos (surprise). So they‚Äôll really get into the <em>‚Äúneed‚Äù</em> for a super fast lens, getting a tone of bokeh and finally some classic composition tips like ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù (all of which can be broken). But CJ Chilvers isn‚Äôt that type of photographer and he focuses on photos for the average person.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what made me think of this post. It‚Äôs great for a complete beginner taking their first photo, but it‚Äôs also a useful reminder for a more seasoned hand who knows all the ‚Äúcomposition rules‚Äù.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I noticed something about Brain Picking‚Äôs blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚ÄúThe most regretful people on earth,‚Äù</em> Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, <em>‚Äúare those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.‚Äù</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/">Walt Witman on Creativity</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an ‚Äúopen loop‚Äù where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man,‚Äù Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, ‚Äúbut one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äî to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/">Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, ‚Äúthe whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/">Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita‚Äôs Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it‚Äôs a shorter quote.</p>

<p>Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.</p>

Reading to an audience is best, because you start really judging the thing when you have to project it into a room full of people. Quentin Tarantino says he likes to read his scripts to his friends, not for their feedback, but their presence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want input, I don‚Äôt want you to tell me if I‚Äôm doing anything wrong, heavens forbid,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúBut I write a scene, and I think I‚Äôve heard it as much as I can, but then when I read it to you ‚Ä¶ I hear it through your ears, and it lets me know I‚Äôm on the right track.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use this trick with proofreading texts. Sometimes I have to look at the same thing that‚Äôs been sent back and forth about five times, often with a minor change introduced that is easily missed. Reading aloud is one of the only ways to keep my eyes fresh.</p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/09/12/hoping-to-be.html">Hoping to Be Delighted by Apple</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Well it‚Äôs Apple iPhone event day and I feel conflicted.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm really ready for a phone upgrade, I want to pass my current phone on to my wife<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> so we can share Live Photos of my daughter, plus then she won‚Äôt have a terrible battery life. But I feel a bit nervous. <strong>I‚Äôm worried Apple won‚Äôt give me a reason to upgrade today.</strong></p>

<p>It‚Äôs a funny fear to have, that someone <strong>won‚Äôt</strong> make you want to give them money. No doubt I‚Äôll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I‚Äôd want to upgrade but at the same time I‚Äôm really not sure where they go next with smartphones.</p>

<p>Personally, I‚Äôm intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn‚Äôt seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.</p>

<p>Regardless, I‚Äôll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don‚Äôt see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.</p>
