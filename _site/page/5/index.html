Surprise Austin takes great pictures with an iPhone again. This weekend I took a photo of a friend on sunny day when he was standing in the shade and it was hot. I suggested moving into the sun for a better picture, but he declined. Smart HDR would have lead to a much better end result. Then there was another moment at home where I suspect Smart HDR would have helped.</p>

<p>This is really making me want a new iPhone.</p>

<p>Yesterday at the airport I wrote out my main takeaways from the international sketchnote camp and today I picked my three main takeaways. There are more I could have chosen and will apply but these really resonated with me. #isc18lx</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>After a session at the <a href="https://sketchnotecamp.wordpress.com">International Sketchnote camp in Lisbon</a> today I felt challenged and excited to share more of my sketchnoting online. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve resisted doing because I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm as good as others and I know that there are sometimes mistakes in my sketchnotes: crooked lines, spelling, running out of space. I was, however, reminded of the value of <strong>sharing your work</strong> as you go along and that, in reality, the process is what is really of value not the product.</p>

<p>But how could I start? What step would be the easiest to get me to share more of my sketchnotes.</p>

<p>The first step.</p>

<p>In my case, this would be <strong>taking the photo of the sketchnote to share</strong>. If I don‚Äôt take the picture, I‚Äôve got nothing to share. Once I‚Äôve taken the photo then I‚Äôve got something to share and it‚Äôs fairly simple to type out a note and share the sketchnote from there. But taking the photo is a hanging point for me. I often don‚Äôt take my phone out, and when it is I forget to/ resist take the photos.</p>

<p>In fact, even if I don‚Äôt share a sketchnote after photographing it, immediately or after a wait, I still have the sketchnote save and more available to share.</p>

<p>I think this applied to many other areas. Just doing the first step can get the process going.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the release of Shortcuts, I cleared out about 70% of my old Workflows in preparation. There were about two or three groups.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Workflows I just never use. In some cases the apps went away or their functionality was replaced with iOS improvements.</li>
  <li>Workflows I replaced with better ones</li>
  <li>Workflows I downloaded to see what the creator had done even though I had no use for them. 
At the same time I also moved my most used workflows to the top of the app and organized some of the workflows near similar ones. I.e. I have a book review and movie review workflow for DayOne, they are next to each other now along with other DayOne workflows.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could have done this at any time but this was the prompt I needed. Maybe I‚Äôll make this a regular thing especially with the experiments I‚Äôve been doing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When you mention time and attention theft, most creators think of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (which I call Facebook II). They usually don‚Äôt think about Youtube or podcasts, which have the same issues: the ad model and all its abuses to the listener, and the lack of quality in favor of burn-out-inducing ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù and quantity (something that is also tied to the ad model).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I recently cut the number of podcast I listen to for similar reasons. With exceptions, podcast tend towards entertainment over content. I don‚Äôt think there is anything inherently wrong with that. <strong>It‚Äôs good to switch off and be entertained from time to time but not all the time.</strong>
Still greater intentionality is always good, as is <a href="http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/09/09/protect-your-attention.html">protecting your attention</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôve tested this app by <a href="https://micro.blog/sharding">@sharding</a> for a couple of weeks and it‚Äôs not like your typical iPhone camera app. It isn‚Äôt feature rich but it has strong opinions. It is influenced by the classic experience of shooting black and white film, with two iconic film simulations, but does so in a non typical way. Most camera apps aim to show you want you are going to see in the end result, Emulsify recreates the unpredictability of film in that you see things in colour before getting your Black and white results. This means you have to train your eye a bit to think about shades and tone and not just colour differences. 
It‚Äôs a very different camera app experience that I suspect some won‚Äôt like, but personally I‚Äôm hooked. That‚Äôs perhaps less surprising considering the amount of black and white film I‚Äôve been burning through recently. Now I just need to get a new iPhone to test the camera on that‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶to help Sean.</p>

  <p>I just think one of the main reasons that the internet took off like it did from the late‚Äì90s onward was that people could finally have a voice, regardless of whether or not that voice drove clicks and views. No need to go through gatekeepers like print publications, book publishers, etc‚Ä¶ we could just write something and hit publish. Now our voices are collectively passed through the values of content marketing and growth-hacking.</p>

<p>I probably could have linked to Paul‚Äôs whole article but what‚Äôs the point in that. So instead I quoted the part I found most inspiring. It‚Äôs a really great take on the difference between blogging and content marketing. This hit me hard as I‚Äôve done a lot of ‚Äúcontentting‚Äù and not that much blogging until I came on Micro.blog‚Ä¶it‚Äôs good to be blogging.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I take my best pictures when I FART first.
FARTing helps us remember to make a strong, meaningful photo instead of just snapping away and winding up with a lot of boring, thoughtless snapshots.
FART is a mnemonic for a creative process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ken Rockwell is not the best photographer in the world and some people really disagree with him on some aspects of photography but this little mnemonic is great photography advice for everyone. I love starting here rathe than ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù or whatever because all of those composition rules can be broken.</p>

<p>I thought of this post as I had seen that <a href="https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/finally-a-photography-101-course-i-can-recommend">CJ Chilvers had written in support</a> of the upcoming <a href="https://thesweetsetup.com/capturing-a-great-photo-on-iphone/">The Sweet Setup Photo course</a>.
Honestly, when they announced they were making photo course I was worried. The feel I usually get from tech journalists who write photo advice focus more on the tech side of photos (surprise). So they‚Äôll really get into the <em>‚Äúneed‚Äù</em> for a super fast lens, getting a tone of bokeh and finally some classic composition tips like ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù (all of which can be broken). But CJ Chilvers isn‚Äôt that type of photographer and he focuses on photos for the average person.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs what made me think of this post. It‚Äôs great for a complete beginner taking their first photo, but it‚Äôs also a useful reminder for a more seasoned hand who knows all the ‚Äúcomposition rules‚Äù.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I noticed something about Brain Picking‚Äôs blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><em>‚ÄúThe most regretful people on earth,‚Äù</em> Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, <em>‚Äúare those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.‚Äù</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/">Walt Witman on Creativity</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It‚Äôs a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an ‚Äúopen loop‚Äù where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man,‚Äù Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, ‚Äúbut one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äî to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/">Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, ‚Äúthe whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.‚Äù</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/">Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita‚Äôs Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska</a></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it‚Äôs a shorter quote.</p>

<p>Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.</p>
