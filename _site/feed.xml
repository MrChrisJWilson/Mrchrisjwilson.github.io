        <title>What makes a good blog - Merlin Mann</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.43folders.com/2008/08/19/good-blogs&quot;&gt;What makes a good blog?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I think about the blogs I’ve returned to over the years – and the increasingly few new ones that really grab my attention – I want to start with, ironically enough, a list. Here’s what I think helps make for a good blog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Merlin Mann&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just discovered this thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/ismh&quot;&gt;@ismh&lt;/a&gt; ‘s &lt;a href=&quot;https://512pixels.net/2018/09/10-years-of-512-pixels/&quot;&gt;ten years of 512 pixels&lt;/a&gt; post and I’d say every bit of it still applies today. Both posts are worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hoping to Be Delighted by Apple</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it’s Apple iPhone event day and I feel conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m really ready for a phone upgrade, I want to pass my current phone on to my wife&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so we can share Live Photos of my daughter, plus then she won’t have a terrible battery life. But I feel a bit nervous. &lt;strong&gt;I’m worried Apple won’t give me a reason to upgrade today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a funny fear to have, that someone &lt;strong&gt;won’t&lt;/strong&gt; make you want to give them money. No doubt I’ll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I’d want to upgrade but at the same time I’m really not sure where they go next with smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I’m intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn’t seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I’ll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don’t see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the record, I’d buy her a new phone but she is very resistant to spending money on herself. &lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finished my last notebook last night and starting a new one today. Trying a different (cheaper) brand but designed for sketching. Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;So I just set up Microsub on my microblog using aperture and downloaded indigenous on my iPhone. Time to take this baby for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Education Needs to Be Inconvenient</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/2018/09/education-needs-to-be-inconvenient/&quot;&gt;Education needs to be inconvenient&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Education needs to be inconvenient because it relies on effort and discomfort to move us from where we were to where we want to be. The internet gives us more access than ever, and if we care enough, we can use that convenient access to explore the inconvenient places that we know we should be exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was trying to write an article and it just &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; coming. The ideas were all jumbled and the thought wasn’t clear or refined. So I finished, and then &lt;em&gt;“published”&lt;/em&gt; to DayOne. I love having a place to send writing that isn’t online for things which are too private or incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Protect your attention</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this sketch in my commonplace book about a week and a half ago and since then this idea has come up a few times for me (including the latest Episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/108&quot;&gt;Hello Internet &lt;/a&gt;. That’s usually a sign to take notice of an idea, when it keeps coming up. It’s also part of the value of a commonplace book, you can notice the themes and ideas that come up again and again and see patterns and connections emerging over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention is one of our most valuable resources and yet nowadays it feels like it’s given away for so little. Even giving away your Email address for some freebie is an invitation to take some of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve made a few changes recently to try and protect my attention more but I know that I both don’t stick to all of those changes and they don’t go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on longer and deeper content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planning silence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limiting disctration time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They’ve all helped but the issue persists. Today I disabled some more notifications, removed another couple of podcasts from my app and finally set some limits in the new screen time settings in iOS 12. I hope they’ll help, but I know the attitude is the most important step.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Thai Rolls </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/ecccd07ce2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/ecccd07ce2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;&quot; class=&quot;sunlit_image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/de43c41c1c.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/de43c41c1c.jpg&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; max-height: 200px; width: auto; padding: 1px;&quot; class=&quot;sunlit_image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d never heard of Thai rolls before but it’s a type of ice cream that basically gets made in front of your eyes. We went for kinder bueno with coconut pieces. Pretty tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a load of articles about “iPad only photo workflows” where I always think “We’ll that’s fine if you take 10 photos”. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fujilove.com/working-on-the-move-what-is-the-lightest-and-most-compact-solution/&quot;&gt;This article is the first which I thought would work for a professional.&lt;/a&gt; with proper backups and file management.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I found myself playing with halide (as it was very low light). The darkroom integration is pretty interesting so now I’m checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesweetsetup.com/shooting-editing-great-photos-halide-darkroom/&quot;&gt;this sweet setup post&lt;/a&gt; in using halide and darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Steal Like The Decemberists</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pca.st/episode/f0742c5d-ba50-4313-a2bf-ebe6271b3ade&quot;&gt;Song Exploder - the Decemberists : once in my life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I was just playing it and playing it over and over again, it reminded me of one of these Yo La Tengo songs called “Barnaby hardly working” which is one of my favourite songs of all time. So we were playing it live and I felt moved one night to sing the last two lines of “Barnaby hardly working”, “lays down by the river, face down by the river”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Meloy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this episode because it’s such a great example of “stealing like an artist”. Referencing the influences that lead to the song but how this diverse group of influences lead to a completely different song that doesn’t sound like the influences at all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Writing Your Job on Your About Page</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I realised that I could add an about page to my Micro.Blog blog and it could be longer than the mini about desciption in my Micro.blog profile (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/simonwood&quot;&gt;@simonwood&lt;/a&gt;). As I was writing it, I did the classic thing that I’ve heard the folk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theminimalists.com/do/&quot;&gt;The minimalists podcast&lt;/a&gt; complain about. &lt;strong&gt;I used my job title to describe myself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In facts, I used my job title as my &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; description of myself. This is the natural and expected course of action. When we meet someone new, one of the first few questions is usually &lt;em&gt;“and what do you do?”&lt;/em&gt; which really means _“What’s your job?” and potentially, “how much do you earn and are you worth my time”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the second part is the highly cynical take from the minimalists which I somewhat agree with. At the same time, if you do a 9-to-5 job, the chances are you spend 1/3 of your day doing that thing (then a further third sleeping) meaning you probably do spend most of your time doing your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last job was a teacher, it’s a pretty well respected thing to include in your profile. People generally think teachers are okay but not necessarily useful for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new job is a title I really like, &lt;strong&gt;“Content Writer”&lt;/strong&gt; which is a way to say &lt;em&gt;“copywriter but we pay you less”&lt;/em&gt; and it reflects a lot of what I like doing, researching and write. But in truth, it’s not a full representation of my character and what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I tried a different &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/about/&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; here, one that focuses on actions and personality traits I want to exhibit first rather than where my paycheck comes from. I’m sure I’ll revisit it and update it, but it’s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evernote lost its CTO, CFO, CPO and HR head in the last month as it eyes another fundraise | TechCrunch</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/evernote-lost-its-cto-cfo-cpo-and-hr-head-in-the-last-month-as-it-eyes-another-fundraise/&quot;&gt;Evernote lost its CTO, CFO, CPO and HR head in the last month as it eyes another fundraise | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that in the last month, Evernote  lost several of its most senior executives, including its CTO Anirban Kundu, CFO Vincent Toolan, CPO Erik Wrobel and head of HR Michelle Wagner beyond the usual attrition of engineers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The departures are coming at a key time: we have also heard that Evernote is fundraising, potentially in a down-round from its most recent (but now several years-old) valuation of $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! This is really not great news. I’ve used Evernote for years and been a paying member for the last three. It’s not a perfect app/service, but it does the job and in the last year the company has really improved (aka, they stopped bugging me about workchat). Still, stuff like this suggests that things may not be so hot, I’d better look for an alternative and a way to move all my notes out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I was opposed to becoming “mileage crazy”. Mileage craziness is a serious condition that exists in many forms. It can hit unsuspecting travellers while driving cars, motorcycles, riding in planes, crossing the country on bicycles or on foot. The symptoms may lead to obsessively placing more importance  on how many miles are traveled than on the real reason for traveling. 
… &lt;strong&gt;A person must be very careful to not be overly concerned with arriving&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Thoughts on the film &quot;Chef&quot; </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I re-watched the film with my wife over the last two days. It’s a film I’ve wanted to revisit for a while but I knew I needed a bit of time. There’s a few storytelling elements that I really love in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the super short summary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the critic at the start of the film is right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Carl’s relationship with his son is the most important storyline&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restoring that relationship leads to his professional success&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The final crisis is all of his own creating and echos the start of the film&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;He ends no longer needing the critics approval.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-critic-is-right&quot;&gt;The critic is right.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, he’s blunt and rude with his criticism but he totally highlights Carl’s issues. He has no creative control (which Carl doesn’t realise at the start) and so his food is bland. Is he really a hater? I’ve seen this online sometimes where unless someone applauds your every move, they are a hater. You can’t offer constructive criticism because any criticism means you are a hater. To be fair, the words the critic uses are attacking the character of Carl so maybe he is a hater…in this case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-storyline-with-his-son-is-more-important-than-his-professional-career&quot;&gt;The storyline with his son is more important than his professional career&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His professional career brilliantly mimics his relationship with his son (and was something I didn’t note when I first watched). At the start, he is just going through the motions with his son just as he is going through the motions at work. The difference is that he &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to be more creative with his work, he just can’t. With his son, he doesn’t seem to want to put in the effort because he is distracted by work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The low point of his career is the low point of his relationship with his son. He goes viral on the internet, loses his job and cancels his plans with his son. This is the “dark night of the soul” moment of the film, where he is directionless and doesn’t know what to do. He has realised his problems in his last job, lack of creative control and stagnation, but he now has no options so he pushes his son away? We all know its the wrong option but it is understandable. He feels useless and doesn’t want his son to see him like this (oh hi pride).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;by-sorting-out-his-relationship-with-his-son-it-leads-to-his-work-life-improving&quot;&gt;By sorting out his relationship with his son, it leads to his work life improving.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking care of his son leads to him getting the idea for his food truck, he’s been presented with the idea before, but now he accepts it &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; his relationship is improving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-final-crisis-is-different-from-the-typical-heros-journey&quot;&gt;The final crisis is different from the typical “Hero’s journey”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic hero’s journey usually takes a different path, we usually have a bigger final conflict where the hero re-faces their old enemy. In Chef it is returning home. Carl starts to take the wrong path and pushes Percy away, but he changes his mind and this leads to our happy ever after ending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;carl-no-longer-needs-the-critics-approval-but-gets-it-anyway&quot;&gt;Carl no longer needs the critics approval, but gets it anyway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This including the critic who tells Carl that he’s back on track. The best touch of this is that Carl no longer cares about the critic, he doesn’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to impress the critic unlike the start of the film where he is dependent on his review. 
It helps to show his progress, but it isn’t as dramatic as the classic hero’s journey and facing the emperor on the death star.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;useful-storytelling-ideas&quot;&gt;Useful storytelling ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like the storytelling devices that Chef uses, some of the shots are great too. It’s not a high stakes thriller but it is a great feel good film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started A Walk Across America (I heard about it via the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchnotearmy.com/blog/2018/8/27/sketchnote-army-podcast-season-05-episode-08-patrick-rhone&quot;&gt;Sketchnote Army Podcast with Patrick Rhone&lt;/a&gt;) and this line from the second chapter really struck me. I was reading the second before and had this gnawing feeling in my chest “Was the post-Vietnam US similar to today?” I can’t answer this for certain, but lines like this make me wonder if there are some echoes in our world today.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Turns out two of my big complaints about DayOne V3 turn out not to be true. I &lt;strong&gt;have&lt;/strong&gt; been grandfathered into my plus scheme &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you can now print books internationally. There are still aspects I miss about the original and I can see someone making a better rival, still I think I’ll stick with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Built to Last </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was fifteen, my dad bough me my first guitar, a Tanglewood dreadnought style acoustic. Last year I brought it over to Poland so I could play it again. I’ve had it over half my life now, and it’s still going strong. It’s showing signs of age and breakdown but it will keep going and may well outlive me (even though it’s not really alive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think about my guitar and other long-lasting tech when I consider most modern technology. With my recent reading of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/?tag=minima0e-20&quot;&gt;Perennial Seller&lt;/a&gt; and the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2018/&quot;&gt;Apple event&lt;/a&gt;, there is a lot of buzz over upgrades and the debates over what device to get. I’m looking at upgrading my phone from an iPhone SE to &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; the iPhone X(s?). I want a smaller phone but one that has the best internals so it will keep going for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really need this upgrade, my iPhone SE still works really well, the iOS 12 beta has made it much faster and more responsive and is like a processor upgrade, and the battery still lasts a good amount of time (and could be upgraded). Despite these factors, a new iPhone is still probably the best idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife has my old iPhone 5s and its battery is not doing so well, in addition we have just become parents and I’d love her to be able to take live photos as well. I’m also worried that the security updates will eventual stop coming for the 5s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be far to Apple, their software updates do help their devices last much longer than the average phone company, and the proliferation of battery replacement recently has helped devices last longer, still I know for sure that even the latest iPhone won’t outlast me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I bought an old hassleblad 500cm, a medium format film camera. It’s from the year I was born and it’s going strong. I can bet it will still be going strong in 30 years time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Does Patreon’s Value Increase the More Things You Back? </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Patreon has always seemed like an interesting idea to me and I’ve backed a few groups for a couple of months at a time. For some reason I always stop. At the same time I back other site memberships. I imagine that I’d love to keep all the sites I’m a member of in one easier to manage location (patreon) and so I suspect the value of patreon for the backer increases the more things you back at the same time. Still, it’s not been enough to get me to back…yet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A dumb nonsensical behaviour from myself. I’ve wanted to sign up as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/relayfm&quot;&gt;@relayfm&lt;/a&gt; member for a couple of years but everytime I’m about to I hit a “paradox of choice” situation. I think I want to give to every show, but there are some shows I don’t listen to so I think about choosing one show…but which one! If I could tick the shows I listen to I would (but that would be much harder to impliment). So I get caught in a mental loop and delay signing up. So today I (finally) signed up for “all the great shows”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Another idea from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/?tag=minima0e-20&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;perennial seller&lt;/strong&gt; by Ryan Holiday&lt;/a&gt;, ideas are cheap, executing really matters. So many people have a &lt;em&gt;“great idea for a book”&lt;/em&gt; but a tiny fraction of those people actually even start writing (and then an even smaller fraction finish. It’s completely true and one of the key changes I made in my early twenties was moving from having ideas to trying out ideas. Later in my twenties I started getting better at finishing those same ideas and not just starting a whole host of new ones. However, that is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; a skill I need to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://jamesaltucher.com/2018/08/3-habits-transform-life/&quot;&gt;James Altchure’s idea factory habit (habit two)&lt;/a&gt;. He seeks to be a constantly thinking of ideas &lt;strong&gt;AND&lt;/strong&gt; reviewing them to only take action on the best ones. While ideas are cheap, we also need ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I remembered &lt;a href=&quot;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9OuG2b7V2sU&quot;&gt;Dan Aierly who described how people want to be given credit for their ideas more than the actions they take.&lt;/a&gt; I can certainly relate and I believe that’s related to why the statement that “ideas are cheap” is so tough to stomach. We want recognition for our ideas, we believe they are valuable, but in reality no one rewards you just for ideas, they reward people for carrying out their ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest little features Evernote made was the “clearly web clipper”. It was so great for saving web article, but also for general web browsing. (I still have it on my mac)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>No, you shouldn't spend 4/5th of your time marketing and 1/5th creating</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m listening to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143109014/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;”perennial seller”&lt;/em&gt; by Ryan Holiday&lt;/a&gt; and early on he takes aim at this truism that’s been going around. spend 1/5th of your time creating and 4/5ths promoting. He said it sounds good but really if your products not up to snuff then you’re trying to generate interest in something which doesn’t matter. (Being cynical it could well be that the type of business advisor who passes on this advice knows that their audiences products aren’t that good).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway I was curious what the biggest companies ad spend to research budget was and if this might inform a better principle/ demonstrate that the 4/5th marketing idea was wrong. So what better place to start than Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;apple-ad-spend-to-rnd&quot;&gt;Apple ad Spend to RnD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s ad spend is now not widely revealed and bundled in with its administrative costs. That’s because it’s under 10% of its expenses and so it isn’t necessary to disclose. The last available figure is from 2015 when it was $1.8 billion. Pretty high, but how did RnD compare in 2015? In fact, in 2015 RnD budget rose by $1.5 billion to aproximaately $5.9 billion. And in 2017 there was a $10 billion RnD spend target. So it’s possible that Apple spends closer to ten times as much on developing products than marketing them. Even a conservative estimate would argue they spend a reverse 4/5ths on creating and 1/5th on marketing,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-motors&quot;&gt;General Motors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about General Motors? Not a one of these modern tech companies but still a form of technology. Well the statistics for 2017 show they spend &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/261531/general-motors-advertising-spending-in-the-us/&quot;&gt;$3.24 billion&lt;/a&gt; on advertising but &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.statista.com/statistics/260866/research-and-development-expenditures-of-general-motors&quot;&gt;$7.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; on Research and development. That’s just over twice as much on research than marketing. Again not the four fifths dynamic that was advised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amazon&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon spent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.recode.net/2017/9/1/16236506/tech-amazon-apple-gdp-spending-productivity&quot;&gt;$16 billion&lt;/a&gt; on research and development last year and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/06/15/amazon-spends-more-on-marketing-than-wal-mart-targ.aspx&quot;&gt;$7 Billion&lt;/a&gt; on advertising in 2016. Seeing as amazon also sells products and has a movie streaming service, we could also include the &lt;a href=&quot;https://businessinsider.com.pl/amazon-video-budget-in-2017-45-billion-2017-4?utm_source=businessinsider.com&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=redirect_businessinsider_com&quot;&gt;$4.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; it spent on acquiring film rights as part of the cost of product vs marketing but regardless, Amazon also spends more on “creating” than marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion-spend-more-time-creating-than-marketing&quot;&gt;Conclusion, spend more time creating than marketing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion from these companies is clear, you should spend more time creating than marketing. It’s much easier to market good products than bad ones.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Good link posts vs bad link post </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Every now and again I come across someone who is critical of this form of micro blogging. They usually argue that all link posts are bad, but personally I’ve found it to be a mixed bag with higher and lower quality. This means there must be some factors which separate good link posts and bad link posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, I think that a good link post is similar to a good blog post, it provides the reader with some for of value. Be that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;entertainment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;education
or whatever, in every case you feel that you got value from that blog post/link post. In terms of link posts, I can identify three forms of value I get from good link posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;1-discovery-via-one-link-post&quot;&gt;1. Discovery via one link post&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where a link is shared and it leads me to an article I wouldn’t have read before. In a situation like this, simply sharing the link on social media might have the same effect but the link post usually makes it stand out more in my RSS feed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;2-discovery-via-the-hive-mind&quot;&gt;2. Discovery via the hive mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where a link is shared once and it passes me by, perhaps the topic sounds boring or the title isn’t very descriptive/interesting. However, soon it seems that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is sharing the same links and I finally give into the pressure and try it out. In this case, it might be quote that the final person shares that makes me crack, but again it is usually the fact that something is being linked everywhere rather than how the link post actually is formatted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;3-commentary&quot;&gt;3. Commentary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third category is where someone takes a link but goes further, they add their unique take or insight on the story. Perhaps it is their own story or whatever, regardless, the value in this case is both the original article &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; the additional commentary. The previous two cases have value in the curation, this last one has value in the link post. That’s why I usually try and write a link post like this, one which has some additional value or insight. That because I think there is a common trait in bad link posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-same-old-same-old&quot;&gt;The same old, same old&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common trait in bad posts is that &lt;strong&gt;this&lt;/strong&gt; link post has no value. Either the link doesn’t pass on value or the commentary doesn’t. Perhaps it’s because I’ve come across the article already, the article isn’t that interesting to me, or the commentary doesn’t really add anything. In this case the more the article gets linked, the worse quality usually comes with it. It’s usually the same old talking points and I’m more likely to have read it or just not be interested in it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steal-dont-copy&quot;&gt;Steal don’t copy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another way to put it would be that you should steal (like an artist) and take some else’s link but not just copy it. Add&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your own insight,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;your favourite quote (and why)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;an experience that was similar (or completely the opposite)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;what questions you have&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;some related links&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;something else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So basically, make sure you give value with your linking and everyone wins. Or don’t and just write for you  and you’ll be happy anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>WWU Lecture on Tolkein’s Language and Writing</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5NKlr0vRX34&quot;&gt;WWU lecture on Tolkein’s language and writing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty fascinating 50 mins talk by Edward Vajda on how Tolkien’s love of languages impacted his writing. One of my favourite points he makes is that the names of places and their languages get more exotic the further you go from The Shire. Bree was influence by Welsh, Gondor and Rohan by Scotland and Ireland, Dwarvish has gramatically characteristics similar to Arabic and Hebrew, The East by Turkish and Hungarian languages which were associated with invaders. So basically the languages inform how you perceive those places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a snack between visits to my daughter in hospital and may have found the best food truck in krakow. Veggie/vegan dumplings/meatballs with an African sauce and black rice. Adds more weight to my theory (which I probably stole) that Vegans have the tastiest food cause they have to care about flavour and can’t just dump some meat in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to the World</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I collapsed on my bed at 2:30 on Wedneday morning after driving home from the hospital. I had been concerned that I wouldn’t be able to fall a sleep but soon my heavy eyes shut for four hours or so till my morning alarm reopened them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four hours earlier my baby girl left her hiding place and entered the world. It’s an experience which was truly mind blowing and left me speechless and frozen. I’m not sure anything could have made me properly prepared though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My daughter has entered a completely different world to the one I did just over thirty years ago. My wife and I were discussing it just the night before that she’ll see incredible things and grow up in a world so removed from our own. She’ll face new challenges (as well as some of the same old ones) and be blessed with new advantages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the last few months I’ve known roughly when my daughter would arrive – though she did decide to arrive early – and with several commitments and invitations I’ve replied that I’d have to see how things are once she is here. This is continuing as she remains in Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m fully prepared for all my once existent free time to disappear in a puff of smoke. It’s certainly made me reevaluate many of the things I’ve been doing. Many of them just don’t see important in the grand scheme of things now, others seem more fun. It’s a big part of my change in writing and embracing micro.blog further as well as enjoying drawing and analogue tools more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, my plans don’t focus that much on me anymore. I’ll be adapting to her needs and wants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to learn more about her and what she’s interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Inside J.R.R. Tolkien’s Notebooks, a Glimpse of the Master Philologist at Work</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/books/review/jrr-tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-elvish-language.html&quot;&gt;Inside J.R.R. Tolkien’s Notebooks, a Glimpse of the Master Philologist at Work&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Tolkien was the first philologist to establish such a network of evolving dialects that derive from one another “by slowly accumulating changes and divergences in form across time from a common ancestor species.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t lie that this hits me in three directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tolkien&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Languages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;notebooks
I found it fascinating his work to include changes between dialects overtime. I’ve read a bit on the languages in Tolkein’s world and the influences of real world languages on Elvish (particularly Welsh on Sindarin) but I hadn’t paid attention to the evolution of these languages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
