        <title>Oh Hi there Micro.Blog</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So after this week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.relay.fm/mpu/417&quot;&gt;Mac Power users podcast&lt;/a&gt; I finally got round to signing up for Micro.Blog. I had been meaning to do so for a bit, especially after seeing people like &lt;a href=&quot;http://decoding.io/&quot;&gt;Zsolt Benke at decoding&lt;/a&gt; using the service on their own site. However I wondered if I should use it on my own site or whatever. In the end, I signed up for a Micro.blog blog as I wanted to help support the service as well. Paying $5 seems like a good way to do so and solved my overthinking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why did I sign up in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-increasing-announance-at-social-media-twitter&quot;&gt;My increasing announance at Social Media (twitter)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve increasingly felt that social media is very “meh”. I hate what Facebook has become as it increasingly tried to grab my attention with cheap tricks and tracks everything I do (no matter if I try to stop that). Twitter too isn’t perfect with its lack of efforts to stop trolling and abuse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-announance-at-blogging&quot;&gt;My announance at blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise I’m fed up of the “professional blogging culture”. There are so many “have tos” with blogging now like:&lt;br /&gt;
- write long posts
- have links
- be helpful
- only show the good sides
- no link posts
- be on a single focus topic
And so on and so on. 
All great advice if you want to make money, but as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/welcome-back-blogging&quot;&gt;CJ Chilvers says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“one is a business model, one is a life model” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what I’m hoping for in this site. Somewhere to play, somewhere to create and somewhere to be unprofessional. &lt;/p&gt;
