        <title>Move Slow and Mend Things? üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brooksreview.net/2018/11/building-technology-for-good/&quot;&gt;https://brooksreview.net/2018/11/building-technology-for-good/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm not sure there is a clear answer, however my gut says that Facebook is more net negative than iPhone. I wonder how much of that could have been avoided if more consideration was given while building out the Facebook, as was given when Apple built iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an interesting link and comment by &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/ben&quot;&gt;@ben&lt;/a&gt;  and I wanted to continue that thought by suggesting the opposite of Facebook‚Äôs approach. Move slow and Mend things. Take your time, consider the impact of your actions and the unintended negative side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder what this would also look like in my personal life. If I didn‚Äôt jump on the latest hype train but waited to let other -suckers- people test them out first and find the issues. If I were more critical of what I let impact my life than I currently am?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I signed up to a course to learn how to use a drawing app on the iPad better. I had a survey about why I signed up and most of the answers suggested that people want to learn about how to turn their art in to a business. I have no interest in that and it actually made completing the survey difficult! 
I understand the idea of trying to segment your course attendees and then up sell a business course (everything seems to have a premium turn your ‚Ä¶ into a business course now) but it really shocked me how ‚ÄúOf course you want to do this‚Äù it was this time. 
What‚Äôs wrong with doing something #justforfun&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A Suggestion for Better Starbucks Cup Size Name</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Something I‚Äôve been wondering about. Starbucks coffee size names.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are clearly influenced by Italian culture and attempt to communicate that but they are confusing so people just use large middle and small (in my experience). So it makes me wonder what could be a better system of names. Ones which reflect Italy but also are clear over the size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Piccolo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Medio&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grande
I don‚Äôt think everyone would use them, but you wouldn‚Äôt have to remember that Vente is in fact the largest coffee size, not the grand grande.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Come for the Topic, Stay for the Hosts?</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I remember hearing Merlin Mann make this statement on back to work some five years ago or so. At the time I nodded my head in agreement, but recently I‚Äôve been questioning this statement a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I initially accepted it as that had been my response with every podcast I listened to, I found them from the topic, but I stayed because I enjoyed the hosts views and the way they talked. In fact, I suspect one of my favorite podcasts of all time had a lot to do with the wonderful timbre of the main host‚Äôs voice. As further proof I could point to podcasts where I had tried but stopped listening to because I didn‚Äôt enjoy the hosts, and Bionic/bonanza which started as an android podcast but descended (well really ascended) into a podcast about secret volcano bases, Elon Musk‚Äôs plans to take over the world, round the world races and saved by the bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But lately I have counter points. Podcasts where I enjoy the hosts (as I have/do listen to their other podcasts), but they have moved away from the original topic and so it no longer appeals to me. Or another podcast where I enjoyed these hosts talking about this topic but now they‚Äôve moved into a more generic topic, they don‚Äôt seem to be as interesting or original.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I think Merlin‚Äôs statement is a great generalization, I now believe a great podcast is a combination of many factors including the topic, the hosts perspectives and views, their interaction off each other and technical factors like good sound recording.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Georgia On My Mind Playlist</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my new listening habits at work is to listen to a jazz classic performed by several different people. One of the best things about Jazz is how different performers interpret and add their own flare onto a standard version. YouTube is such a great place to find these variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLykefMsqC1nda54r6js-w5tOFCc7YTCgd&quot;&gt;playlist of variations of Georgia on my mind&lt;/a&gt;, some more jazzy, some more bluesy, many are solo guitar pieces but some have backing tracking or a band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.s. I‚Äôve made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/jazz-standards/&quot;&gt;new page where I‚Äôll collect some of these lists.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the Google features that I find incredibly useful and very worrisome is maps telling you predicted busy hours and live results. I often use it to plan when I go to the shops, and yet it is so upfront about how Google is tracking you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I still love paper </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In many ways I think my attachment for my smartphone is born out of my same attachment for notebooks and pens. The later preceded the former when my father gifted me a translucent purple covered a6 pocket notebook at high school. 
The point was to write my tasks and assignments so I wouldn‚Äôt have to rely on my very fallible memory and instead stay organized and on top of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason it stuck was because I also had a set of bright neon pens that I used to reimagine the cover and pages inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nethertheless, the notebook did it‚Äôs job and lead to a transformative moment in my life. I can divide my life into the disorganized forgetful mess I was before I had my first notebook, and the increasingly organizing and effective person I am still becoming since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I went looking to get my first smartphone, the one feature I wanted was a good calendar so I could replace my paper one. I didn‚Äôt care about any games or the camera, they were of far lesser importance than the calendar and notes. To this day, my calendar, task manager and notes app are in my top five most used apps (the camera and podcast app are also present).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But despite the usefulness of these applications, there‚Äôs still something delightful about paper and pen. The blank page is a creative curse, but it can also be an inspiring invitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A blank page can become a picture, a task list, a quick doodle for no reason, a profound quote to be remembered, or a brain dump of ideas and concerns regarding a project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As great as my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil are, they aren‚Äôt the same as a good pen and notebook.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Go on an ‚ÄúArtist date‚Äù</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made the image below inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.accidentalcreative.com/podcasts/ac/three-weekend-rituals-that-will-refresh-your-creativity/&quot;&gt;the accidental creative podcast&lt;/a&gt; this morning, which was itself inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/artists-dates/&quot;&gt;Julia Cameron&lt;/a&gt;.

        <title>The Annoying Trend of Making Stuff About Making Stuff</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the things that annoys me the most about the modern internet landscape is how much stuff is made about making stuff. Especially when it is the same form as the thing which is being made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Blog posts about writing blog posts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Youtube Videos about making YouTube videos&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Podcasts about podcasts (this is probably the least offender)
I now wonder if this is part of the inherit nature of being an indie creator. If you become successful and go full time, then the thing you are making becomes your full time job. What else can you write about‚Ä¶except writing about running your job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;strong&gt;it‚Äôs not inevitable&lt;/strong&gt; and I think the &lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt; online content avoids this pitfall. CGP Grey‚Äôs great videos aren‚Äôt about how he makes his videos, Amanda Palmer‚Äôs music isn‚Äôt about making music and Andy Weir wrote a great book about a man on mars on his blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My challenge to myself is to focus more on making things, and not making things about making things.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The digital divide is being flipped üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://seths.blog/2018/11/the-digital-divide-is-being-flipped/&quot;&gt;The Digital Divide is Being Flipped - Seths Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Today, as digital tools get cheaper and more widespread, a new gap is appearing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If a parent uses a tablet or a smartphone as a babysitter, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get a kid to sit still. As a result, parents who are busy, distracted or can‚Äôt afford to spend as much 1:1 time as they‚Äôd like are unknowingly encouraging their kids to become digital zombies, with a constant need for stimulation, who are being manipulated by digital overlords to click and click some more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past in Europe, pale skin was seen as attractive, as people who were suntanned worked in the fields. Now, the reverse is true as it is a sign of not working to have travel abroad and obtained your tan. This digital situation reminds me of getting tanned, the element which distinguished you in the past was access to the internet, now it is being able to disconnect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/dp/1455586692/?tag=minima0e-20&quot;&gt;Deep Work by Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; (affiliate link)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Where are the fresh blogging opinions üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macdrifter.com/2018/11/daring-fireball-dan-frakes-goes-to-apple-as-mac-app-store-editor.html&quot;&gt;Daring Fireball: Dan Frakes Goes to Apple as Mac App Store Editor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cross linking between blogs has nearly dried up. It‚Äôs almost impossible to find new opinions because everyone links to the same three websites, like I‚Äôm doing now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A lot of voices have moved on to podcasting. Frankly, as someone that also podcasts, it‚Äôs easier and there‚Äôs less accountability than with blogging. Today, I also see a lot of thoughtful people writing on Discord groups. There‚Äôs little value in blogging unless you just like to practice writing in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of those articles that starts discussing one issue, but the commentary actually is far more interesting than the inital discussion (In my opinion at least). I wonder how accurate Gabe‚Äôs prognosis is (that new voices are podcasting). While I see truth in this, I also think one of the issues is that online writing has become quite formulaic and people simply copy others ideas without offering something fresh. 
No one could be a full time blogger in the early days of online writing, now there are a host of them (and companies that employ writers) who‚Äôs opinions are well regarded. I‚Äôve started (and stopped) following some new writers as I realised they were just repeating others points. At the same time, I have discovered fresh voices who offer something unique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://rosemaryorchard.com/&quot;&gt;Rose Orchard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beardyguycreative.com/blog/&quot;&gt;Denny Henke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://decoding.io/&quot;&gt;Zsolt Benke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gr36.com/&quot;&gt;Greg Morris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thedent.net/&quot;&gt;Andy Nicolaides&lt;/a&gt;
Admittedly some of those same voices also use their litteral voices for podcasts too, but that doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that they are adding their unique writing voice. Really, it‚Äôs not that writing is in decline, it‚Äôs that more writers are also professional podcasters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>No one makes a living on Pateron üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://theoutline.com/post/2571/no-one-makes-a-living-on-patreon?zd=1&amp;amp;zi=mkw4iinv&quot;&gt;No one makes a living on Patreon &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of those creators, only 1,393 ‚Äî 2 percent ‚Äî make the equivalent of federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, or $1,160 a month, in October 2017. Worse, if we change it to $15 per hour, a minimum wage slowly being adopted by states, that‚Äôs only .8 percent of all creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of depressing reading as it casts a lot of doubt on pateron and donations as long term viable income streams. At the same time, it‚Äôs not the &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; suprising statistic and seems to refect common distribution curves where the top far out performs the majority.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;We‚Äôre in our favourite coffee shop in Kazimierz, the old Jewish district in Krakow, and there are free short stories. This one is a graphic novel.

        <title>November 2018 Now and Then Update</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I tried updating my &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/now/&quot;&gt;Now page&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the month and &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/10/01/now-and-then.html&quot;&gt;writing a description of what had occurred&lt;/a&gt;, and what is coming up. It‚Äôs kind of a ‚Äúmonthly review‚Äù for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here‚Äôs my November 2018 Now and Then Update&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;then&quot;&gt;Then&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goals&lt;/strong&gt;
My goals for last month were a mixed bag
 Spend time with my daughter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I caught up with the copyblogger course I‚Äôm doing and now just need to submit some work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did nothing for ‚Äúthe ninja project‚Äù and it‚Äôs probably on the back burner unfortunately.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I read very little more of On Writing Well but I did read some. I‚Äôm hoping to slowly continue this month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did try a couple of calligraphy styles, but the main thing I did was investigate the Pentel brush pen by doing Inktober only using that pen. It was a really fun challenge to try an unusual and different pen. I kind of want to do something similar with a different pen next month and see what comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My writing portfolio still needs a bit of an update but it‚Äôs coming along well&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did nothing for NaNoWriMo but I‚Äôm going to start free writing everyday, it may lead to a book, or not. Hopefully it will stick beyond just November.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn‚Äôt plan to, but I ended up completing Inktober and I‚Äôm going to put a micro.blog post with every image.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I spent far too much time considering what new phone I should get. I had placed some limits and requirements to stop me upgrading sooner and they were now all met. However, I didn‚Äôt want to blindly follow my gut but really check and make sure I was making a good choice that reflecting a suitable use of money. At times like this I like to review why I don‚Äôt use certain products and consider what it would be like to switch system as well as the pain points. In this case I really considered getting an Android phone. There are certainly some advantages but I‚Äôve happily decided against doing so, I placed one last restriction on myself to give myself time to make sure I was happy with my final decision and so in a week or so, I should upgrade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My parents visited and met their Granddaughter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My in-laws visited again and we prepared some great food.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We went to a wedding in Lublin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I had a major project at work that was a great challenge, but quite stressful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected delights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting reading Atomic Habits by James Clear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Getting back in to exercising after some illness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;David Sparks Omnifocus field guide provided some really interesting ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve really got back into Jazz music again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;now&quot;&gt;Now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time I talked about goals, this month (inspired by James Clear) I want to focus on habits instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Daily writing first thing (instead of browsing and searching the internet)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Playing some Jazz guitar at the weekend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Personalizing a couple more Siri Shortcuts so they are more useful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Going through a couple of courses I signed up for in the past‚Ä¶and did nothing with!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôm looking for a better way to manage quotes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upcoming events&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My wife‚Äôs birthday&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some national holidays (1st November and 11th)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>A Long-Term Review of The Focus Course</title>
        
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe Focus Course helped me create a manageable plan of action that worked with my work and lifestyle that I could easily implement.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Me&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed the Focus Course had reopened today and my testimonial (the one above from being one of the initial beta testers) is still there. This made me reflect on the course and what has changed since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I‚Äôve got married&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I bought a home&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I welcomed my daughter into the world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;and I changed job&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There‚Äôs more that‚Äôs occured of course, but these points ‚Äî espeically the last point ‚Äî really highlight The Focus Course‚Äôs legacy in my life. At the end of the Focus Course, I had set several core goals, I also chose a simple habit to impliment, the one which would lead to the biggest impact on my life. It was to ‚Äúdo a fitstar workout everyday‚Äù to help move toward my health goal. Now I go to the gym twice a week, have hit the weight goal I was aiming for (I have trouble with being underweight) and am much healthier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In work, I left my job as a teacher this summer and became a content writer. It was a long term professional goal to write for a living but one that felt so distant. Still, I kept writing. This habit with sprint targets kept me moving and eventually someone noticed. I wouldn‚Äôt have followed this path were it not for the Focus Course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setbacks-along-the-way&quot;&gt;Setbacks along the way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been setbacks along the way. I‚Äôve had periods of distraction ‚Äî I‚Äôve recently noticed that I am distracted more by my phone than before ‚Äî and some goals didn‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôve tried things and changed my mind. I‚Äôve had periods where I didn‚Äôt even check on my goals. But I can still access the Focus Course and have redone the course twice since I first took it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm about to restart the course again and I‚Äôm sure it will be different this time. For instance, I have a daughter now and this is new. Certianly some of the task will end up differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;you-should-do-the-focus-course&quot;&gt;You should do the Focus Course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The focus course isn‚Äôt cheap but it is one of the most life changing things I‚Äôve done in my life. The method of learning is one that I‚Äôve tired to use in learning courses I‚Äôve set up and if you stick to it, it will make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://thefocuscourse.com/course/&quot;&gt;You can sign up here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have no affiliate relationship with the focus course, this recommendation is just that. A heartfelt recommendation of something that will make a difference for you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
