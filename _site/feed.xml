  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWe have tears in our eyes
As we wave our goodbyes,
We so loved being with you, we three.
So do please now and then
Come and see us again,
The Giraffe and the Pelly and me.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodbye #ISC18LX

        <title>Take the first step</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After a session at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchnotecamp.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;International Sketchnote camp in Lisbon&lt;/a&gt; today I felt challenged and excited to share more of my sketchnoting online. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve resisted doing because I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôm as good as others and I know that there are sometimes mistakes in my sketchnotes: crooked lines, spelling, running out of space. I was, however, reminded of the value of &lt;strong&gt;sharing your work&lt;/strong&gt; as you go along and that, in reality, the process is what is really of value not the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how could I start? What step would be the easiest to get me to share more of my sketchnotes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, this would be &lt;strong&gt;taking the photo of the sketchnote to share&lt;/strong&gt;. If I don‚Äôt take the picture, I‚Äôve got nothing to share. Once I‚Äôve taken the photo then I‚Äôve got something to share and it‚Äôs fairly simple to type out a note and share the sketchnote from there. But taking the photo is a hanging point for me. I often don‚Äôt take my phone out, and when it is I forget to/ resist take the photos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, even if I don‚Äôt share a sketchnote after photographing it, immediately or after a wait, I still have the sketchnote save and more available to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this applied to many other areas. Just doing the first step can get the process going.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>The Mac Sparky Shortcuts Field Guide [Mini Review]</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just finished the &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.macsparky.com/p/siri&quot;&gt;MacSparky Shortcuts Field Guide&lt;/a&gt; 
My tldr; it‚Äôs great for people new to workflow/shortcuts and those who have one or two but never really make their own and want ideas. 
If you‚Äôve made a shortcut with multiple apps and variables before, this is probably not for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cleaning Up Workflows</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the release of Shortcuts, I cleared out about 70% of my old Workflows in preparation. There were about two or three groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workflows I just never use. In some cases the apps went away or their functionality was replaced with iOS improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workflows I replaced with better ones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workflows I downloaded to see what the creator had done even though I had no use for them. 
At the same time I also moved my most used workflows to the top of the app and organized some of the workflows near similar ones. I.e. I have a book review and movie review workflow for DayOne, they are next to each other now along with other DayOne workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have done this at any time but this was the prompt I needed. Maybe I‚Äôll make this a regular thing especially with the experiments I‚Äôve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally moved from TextExpander legacy to a subscription. I‚Äôve had issues with syncing snippets for a while and yet I use this tool so often it‚Äôs worth paying for its support.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should We Stop Listening to Podcasts? ‚Äî CJ Chilvers üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/should-we-stop-listening-to-podcasts&quot;&gt;Should We Stop Listening to Podcasts? ‚Äî CJ Chilvers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you mention time and attention theft, most creators think of Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (which I call Facebook II). They usually don‚Äôt think about Youtube or podcasts, which have the same issues: the ad model and all its abuses to the listener, and the lack of quality in favor of burn-out-inducing ‚Äúconsistency‚Äù and quantity (something that is also tied to the ad model).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently cut the number of podcast I listen to for similar reasons. With exceptions, podcast tend towards entertainment over content. I don‚Äôt think there is anything inherently wrong with that. &lt;strong&gt;It‚Äôs good to switch off and be entertained from time to time but not all the time.&lt;/strong&gt;
Still greater intentionality is always good, as is &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/2018/09/09/protect-your-attention.html&quot;&gt;protecting your attention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Emulsify Camera from Sean Harding (Like shooting black and white film)</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/emulsify-camera/id1408272207?mt=8&quot;&gt;Emulsify Camera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve tested this app by &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/sharding&quot;&gt;@sharding&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of weeks and it‚Äôs not like your typical iPhone camera app. It isn‚Äôt feature rich but it has strong opinions. It is influenced by the classic experience of shooting black and white film, with two iconic film simulations, but does so in a non typical way. Most camera apps aim to show you want you are going to see in the end result, Emulsify recreates the unpredictability of film in that you see things in colour before getting your Black and white results. This means you have to train your eye a bit to think about shades and tone and not just colour differences. 
It‚Äôs a very different camera app experience that I suspect some won‚Äôt like, but personally I‚Äôm hooked. That‚Äôs perhaps less surprising considering the amount of black and white film I‚Äôve been burning through recently. Now I just need to get a new iPhone to test the camera on that‚Ä¶you know‚Ä¶to help Sean.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since Apple Pay (finally) came to Poland I‚Äôve been really pleased with it, espeically on the watch. But the last week or two has shown me how great Apple Pay on the Web is. It‚Äôs much easier than many other systems. ( Need to remember the danger of ease leading to spending more).&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I‚Äôd rather be a blogger ‚Äì Paul Jarvis üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pjrvs.com/blogger/?mc_cid=aa65d786c3&amp;amp;mc_eid=d098183321&quot;&gt;I‚Äôd rather be a blogger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just think one of the main reasons that the internet took off like it did from the late‚Äì90s onward was that people could finally have a voice, regardless of whether or not that voice drove clicks and views. No need to go through gatekeepers like print publications, book publishers, etc‚Ä¶ we could just write something and hit publish. Now our voices are collectively passed through the values of content marketing and growth-hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I probably could have linked to Paul‚Äôs whole article but what‚Äôs the point in that. So instead I quoted the part I found most inspiring. It‚Äôs a really great take on the difference between blogging and content marketing. This hit me hard as I‚Äôve done a lot of ‚Äúcontentting‚Äù and not that much blogging until I came on Micro.blog‚Ä¶it‚Äôs good to be blogging.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>FART for better photos - Ken Rockwell </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kenrockwell.com/tech/fart.htm&quot;&gt;Fart for better photos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I take my best pictures when I FART first.
FARTing helps us remember to make a strong, meaningful photo instead of just snapping away and winding up with a lot of boring, thoughtless snapshots.
FART is a mnemonic for a creative process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ken Rockwell is not the best photographer in the world and some people really disagree with him on some aspects of photography but this little mnemonic is great photography advice for everyone. I love starting here rathe than ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù or whatever because all of those composition rules can be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought of this post as I had seen that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/finally-a-photography-101-course-i-can-recommend&quot;&gt;CJ Chilvers had written in support&lt;/a&gt; of the upcoming &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesweetsetup.com/capturing-a-great-photo-on-iphone/&quot;&gt;The Sweet Setup Photo course&lt;/a&gt;.
Honestly, when they announced they were making photo course I was worried. The feel I usually get from tech journalists who write photo advice focus more on the tech side of photos (surprise). So they‚Äôll really get into the &lt;em&gt;‚Äúneed‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; for a super fast lens, getting a tone of bokeh and finally some classic composition tips like ‚Äúthe rule of thirds‚Äù (all of which can be broken). But CJ Chilvers isn‚Äôt that type of photographer and he focuses on photos for the average person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs what made me think of this post. It‚Äôs great for a complete beginner taking their first photo, but it‚Äôs also a useful reminder for a more seasoned hand who knows all the ‚Äúcomposition rules‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How Maria Popova starts a blog post. </title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed something about Brain Picking‚Äôs blog posts that made me investigate. It was the curious way Maria chose to start her post. By splitting a quote in two and referencing the writer in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‚ÄúThe most regretful people on earth,‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; Mary Oliver wrote in her beautiful reflection on the central commitment of the creative life, &lt;em&gt;‚Äúare those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.‚Äù&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/14/walt-whitman-on-creativity/&quot;&gt;Walt Witman on Creativity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a great way to kick of some writing as it creates an ‚Äúopen loop‚Äù where you want to know the answer to the end of the quote. I wondered if she does this all the time as I recognised the style, and sure enough I found a post from a few days before with the same style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;‚ÄúEverything can be taken from a man,‚Äù Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl wrote in his timeless treatise on the human search for meaning, ‚Äúbut one thing: the last of the human freedoms ‚Äî to choose one‚Äôs attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one‚Äôs own way.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/10/toni-morrison-beloved-freedom/&quot;&gt;Toni Morrison on the Deepest Meaning of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it is not the only way she kicks of a post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The pioneering naturalist John Muir held the poetic conviction that when we look closely at any aspect of our world, ‚Äúthe whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/09/12/ryota-kajita-ice-formation/&quot;&gt;Japanese Artist Ryota Kajita‚Äôs Otherworldly Photographs of Ice Formation in Alaska&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here she starts with the description and places the quote in full. The key difference, it‚Äôs a shorter quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless Maria certainly seems to like her quotes to kick off her posts.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;the number of companies who sent me emails saying that I &lt;strong&gt;had&lt;/strong&gt; to update my preference to keep getting emails post GDPR (I didn‚Äôt ) and  then kept emailing me is not insignificant.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Do you let any website give you push notifications? I see requests so often and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone actually accepts (and if there are any occasions when it might even be good!) The only one I can imagine ever accepting is my favourite blog and even then I‚Äôd prefer RSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It has also been observed that if a person finds themselves engaging in activities which are in opposition to what they believe, they will be &lt;strong&gt;more willing to change their belief or adopt new beliefs to suit the situation, rather than change their actions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm researching for an article and this statement really struck me. People will change their beliefs to match their actions more than change their actions.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reading Aloud - Austin Kleon üîó</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://austinkleon.com/2018/09/12/reading-aloud/&quot;&gt;Reading aloud&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I find that reading my work aloud makes it weird enough that I can‚Äôt scan or gloss over anything.
Reading to an audience is best, because you start really judging the thing when you have to project it into a room full of people. Quentin Tarantino says he likes to read his scripts to his friends, not for their feedback, but their presence. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want input, I don‚Äôt want you to tell me if I‚Äôm doing anything wrong, heavens forbid,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúBut I write a scene, and I think I‚Äôve heard it as much as I can, but then when I read it to you ‚Ä¶ I hear it through your ears, and it lets me know I‚Äôm on the right track.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use this trick with proofreading texts. Sometimes I have to look at the same thing that‚Äôs been sent back and forth about five times, often with a minor change introduced that is easily missed. Reading aloud is one of the only ways to keep my eyes fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me another five minutes later: Hum, maybe the iPhone Xr is a real bargain‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What makes a good blog - Merlin Mann</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I think about the blogs I‚Äôve returned to over the years ‚Äì and the increasingly few new ones that really grab my attention ‚Äì I want to start with, ironically enough, a list. Here‚Äôs what I think helps make for a good blog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Merlin Mann&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just discovered this thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/ismh&quot;&gt;@ismh&lt;/a&gt; ‚Äòs &lt;a href=&quot;https://512pixels.net/2018/09/10-years-of-512-pixels/&quot;&gt;ten years of 512 pixels&lt;/a&gt; post and I‚Äôd say every bit of it still applies today. Both posts are worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hoping to Be Delighted by Apple</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Well it‚Äôs Apple iPhone event day and I feel conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm really ready for a phone upgrade, I want to pass my current phone on to my wife&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; so we can share Live Photos of my daughter, plus then she won‚Äôt have a terrible battery life. But I feel a bit nervous. &lt;strong&gt;I‚Äôm worried Apple won‚Äôt give me a reason to upgrade today.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs a funny fear to have, that someone &lt;strong&gt;won‚Äôt&lt;/strong&gt; make you want to give them money. No doubt I‚Äôll change my mind as they could probably just release a phone with a new processor and I‚Äôd want to upgrade but at the same time I‚Äôm really not sure where they go next with smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personally, I‚Äôm intrigued by the idea of a foldable phone and I suspect something like a Samsung note that can unfold into a small square tablet with stylus could be very interesting. But that doesn‚Äôt seem on the horizon for Apple. Then again it is not unlike Apple to quietly work away at something for a while and then suddenly release it upon the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, I‚Äôll be watching the keynote (or more likely checking the summary afterwards) and hoping that there will be a surprise or two that I don‚Äôt see coming. Apple are often good at delivering those sweet hardware and software features that delight and perhaps the iPhone Xs will see some new delight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;footnotes&quot;&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li id=&quot;fn:1&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For the record, I‚Äôd buy her a new phone but she is very resistant to spending money on herself.¬†&lt;a href=&quot;#fnref:1&quot; class=&quot;reversefootnote&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>Education Needs to Be Inconvenient</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Education needs to be inconvenient because it relies on effort and discomfort to move us from where we were to where we want to be. The internet gives us more access than ever, and if we care enough, we can use that convenient access to explore the inconvenient places that we know we should be exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Protect your attention</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I made this sketch in my commonplace book about a week and a half ago and since then this idea has come up a few times for me (including the latest Episode of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hellointernet.fm/podcast/108&quot;&gt;Hello Internet &lt;/a&gt;. That‚Äôs usually a sign to take notice of an idea, when it keeps coming up. It‚Äôs also part of the value of a commonplace book, you can notice the themes and ideas that come up again and again and see patterns and connections emerging over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attention is one of our most valuable resources and yet nowadays it feels like it‚Äôs given away for so little. Even giving away your Email address for some freebie is an invitation to take some of your attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve made a few changes recently to try and protect my attention more but I know that I both don‚Äôt stick to all of those changes and they don‚Äôt go far enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Focusing on longer and deeper content&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;planning silence&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;limiting disctration time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They‚Äôve all helped but the issue persists. Today I disabled some more notifications, removed another couple of podcasts from my app and finally set some limits in the new screen time settings in iOS 12. I hope they‚Äôll help, but I know the attitude is the most important step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôd never heard of Thai rolls before but it‚Äôs a type of ice cream that basically gets made in front of your eyes. We went for kinder bueno with coconut pieces. Pretty tasty.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Looks like you can browse the old discover articles in iOS 12 now.The question is have they restored this feature or is it a beta bug?&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;A few times I‚Äôve asked a question and people have said ‚Äúhey, where did you find that‚Äù most of the time it‚Äôs from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://help.micro.blog/archive/&quot;&gt;help page archive&lt;/a&gt; well worth a check for little things you may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve seen a load of articles about ‚ÄúiPad only photo workflows‚Äù where I always think ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll that‚Äôs fine if you take 10 photos‚Äù. &lt;a href=&quot;https://fujilove.com/working-on-the-move-what-is-the-lightest-and-most-compact-solution/&quot;&gt;This article is the first which I thought would work for a professional.&lt;/a&gt; with proper backups and file management.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night I found myself playing with halide (as it was very low light). The darkroom integration is pretty interesting so now I‚Äôm checking out &lt;a href=&quot;https://thesweetsetup.com/shooting-editing-great-photos-halide-darkroom/&quot;&gt;this sweet setup post&lt;/a&gt; in using halide and darkroom.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Steal Like The Decemberists</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pca.st/episode/f0742c5d-ba50-4313-a2bf-ebe6271b3ade&quot;&gt;Song Exploder - the Decemberists : once in my life&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I was just playing it and playing it over and over again, it reminded me of one of these Yo La Tengo songs called ‚ÄúBarnaby hardly working‚Äù which is one of my favourite songs of all time. So we were playing it live and I felt moved one night to sing the last two lines of ‚ÄúBarnaby hardly working‚Äù, ‚Äúlays down by the river, face down by the river‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Meloy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this episode because it‚Äôs such a great example of ‚Äústealing like an artist‚Äù. Referencing the influences that lead to the song but how this diverse group of influences lead to a completely different song that doesn‚Äôt sound like the influences at all.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Writing Your Job on Your About Page</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I realised that I could add an about page to my Micro.Blog blog and it could be longer than the mini about desciption in my Micro.blog profile (thanks &lt;a href=&quot;https://micro.blog/simonwood&quot;&gt;@simonwood&lt;/a&gt;). As I was writing it, I did the classic thing that I‚Äôve heard the folk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theminimalists.com/do/&quot;&gt;The minimalists podcast&lt;/a&gt; complain about. &lt;strong&gt;I used my job title to describe myself&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In facts, I used my job title as my &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt; description of myself. This is the natural and expected course of action. When we meet someone new, one of the first few questions is usually &lt;em&gt;‚Äúand what do you do?‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; which really means _‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your job?‚Äù and potentially, ‚Äúhow much do you earn and are you worth my time‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, the second part is the highly cynical take from the minimalists which I somewhat agree with. At the same time, if you do a 9-to-5 job, the chances are you spend 1/3 of your day doing that thing (then a further third sleeping) meaning you probably do spend most of your time doing your job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last job was a teacher, it‚Äôs a pretty well respected thing to include in your profile. People generally think teachers are okay but not necessarily useful for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My new job is a title I really like, &lt;strong&gt;‚ÄúContent Writer‚Äù&lt;/strong&gt; which is a way to say &lt;em&gt;‚Äúcopywriter but we pay you less‚Äù&lt;/em&gt; and it reflects a lot of what I like doing, researching and write. But in truth, it‚Äôs not a full representation of my character and what I do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I tried a different &lt;a href=&quot;http://chrisjwilson.me/about/&quot;&gt;About page&lt;/a&gt; here, one that focuses on actions and personality traits I want to exhibit first rather than where my paycheck comes from. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll revisit it and update it, but it‚Äôs a start.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Evernote lost its CTO, CFO, CPO and HR head in the last month as it eyes another fundraise | TechCrunch</title>
        
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/04/evernote-lost-its-cto-cfo-cpo-and-hr-head-in-the-last-month-as-it-eyes-another-fundraise/&quot;&gt;Evernote lost its CTO, CFO, CPO and HR head in the last month as it eyes another fundraise | TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;TechCrunch has learned and confirmed that in the last month, Evernote  lost several of its most senior executives, including its CTO Anirban Kundu, CFO Vincent Toolan, CPO Erik Wrobel and head of HR Michelle Wagner beyond the usual attrition of engineers and designers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The departures are coming at a key time: we have also heard that Evernote is¬†fundraising, potentially in a down-round from its most recent (but now several years-old) valuation of $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! This is really not great news. I‚Äôve used Evernote for years and been a paying member for the last three. It‚Äôs not a perfect app/service, but it does the job and in the last year the company has really improved (aka, they stopped bugging me about workchat). Still, stuff like this suggests that things may not be so hot, I‚Äôd better look for an alternative and a way to move all my notes out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But I was opposed to becoming ‚Äúmileage crazy‚Äù. Mileage craziness is a serious condition that exists in many forms. It can hit unsuspecting travellers while driving cars, motorcycles, riding in planes, crossing the country on bicycles or on foot. The symptoms may lead to obsessively placing more importance  on how many miles are traveled than on the real reason for traveling. 
‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;A person must be very careful to not be overly concerned with arriving&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
