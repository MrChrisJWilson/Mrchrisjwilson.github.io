        <h2><a href="/2018/08/25/good-link-posts.html">Good link posts vs bad link post </a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Every now and again I come across someone who is critical of this form of micro blogging. They usually argue that all link posts are bad, but personally I’ve found it to be a mixed bag with higher and lower quality. This means there must be some factors which separate good link posts and bad link posts.</p>

<p>In truth, I think that a good link post is similar to a good blog post, it provides the reader with some for of value. Be that</p>
<ul>
  <li>entertainment</li>
  <li>education
or whatever, in every case you feel that you got value from that blog post/link post. In terms of link posts, I can identify three forms of value I get from good link posts.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="1-discovery-via-one-link-post">1. Discovery via one link post</h2>
<p>This is where a link is shared and it leads me to an article I wouldn’t have read before. In a situation like this, simply sharing the link on social media might have the same effect but the link post usually makes it stand out more in my RSS feed.</p>

<h2 id="2-discovery-via-the-hive-mind">2. Discovery via the hive mind</h2>
<p>This is where a link is shared once and it passes me by, perhaps the topic sounds boring or the title isn’t very descriptive/interesting. However, soon it seems that <em>everyone</em> is sharing the same links and I finally give into the pressure and try it out. In this case, it might be quote that the final person shares that makes me crack, but again it is usually the fact that something is being linked everywhere rather than how the link post actually is formatted.</p>

<h2 id="3-commentary">3. Commentary</h2>
<p>The third category is where someone takes a link but goes further, they add their unique take or insight on the story. Perhaps it is their own story or whatever, regardless, the value in this case is both the original article <strong>and</strong> the additional commentary. The previous two cases have value in the curation, this last one has value in the link post. That’s why I usually try and write a link post like this, one which has some additional value or insight. That because I think there is a common trait in bad link posts.</p>

<h2 id="the-same-old-same-old">The same old, same old</h2>
<p>The common trait in bad posts is that <strong>this</strong> link post has no value. Either the link doesn’t pass on value or the commentary doesn’t. Perhaps it’s because I’ve come across the article already, the article isn’t that interesting to me, or the commentary doesn’t really add anything. In this case the more the article gets linked, the worse quality usually comes with it. It’s usually the same old talking points and I’m more likely to have read it or just not be interested in it.</p>

<h2 id="steal-dont-copy">Steal don’t copy</h2>
<p>Another way to put it would be that you should steal (like an artist) and take some else’s link but not just copy it. Add</p>
<ul>
  <li>your own insight,</li>
  <li>your favourite quote (and why)</li>
  <li>an experience that was similar (or completely the opposite)</li>
  <li>what questions you have</li>
  <li>some related links</li>
  <li>something else</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically, make sure you give value with your linking and everyone wins. Or don’t and just write for you  and you’ll be happy anyway.</p>

        <p><a href="https://youtu.be/5NKlr0vRX34">WWU lecture on Tolkein’s language and writing</a></p>

<p>This is a pretty fascinating 50 mins talk by Edward Vajda on how Tolkien’s love of languages impacted his writing. One of my favourite points he makes is that the names of places and their languages get more exotic the further you go from The Shire. Bree was influence by Welsh, Gondor and Rohan by Scotland and Ireland, Dwarvish has gramatically characteristics similar to Arabic and Hebrew, The East by Turkish and Hungarian languages which were associated with invaders. So basically the languages inform how you perceive those places.</p>

<p>I needed a snack between visits to my daughter in hospital and may have found the best food truck in krakow. Veggie/vegan dumplings/meatballs with an African sauce and black rice. Adds more weight to my theory (which I probably stole) that Vegans have the tastiest food cause they have to care about flavour and can’t just dump some meat in.</p>

      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>I collapsed on my bed at 2:30 on Wedneday morning after driving home from the hospital. I had been concerned that I wouldn’t be able to fall a sleep but soon my heavy eyes shut for four hours or so till my morning alarm reopened them.</p>

<p>Four hours earlier my baby girl left her hiding place and entered the world. It’s an experience which was truly mind blowing and left me speechless and frozen. I’m not sure anything could have made me properly prepared though.</p>

<p>My daughter has entered a completely different world to the one I did just over thirty years ago. My wife and I were discussing it just the night before that she’ll see incredible things and grow up in a world so removed from our own. She’ll face new challenges (as well as some of the same old ones) and be blessed with new advantages.</p>

<p>For the last few months I’ve known roughly when my daughter would arrive – though she did decide to arrive early – and with several commitments and invitations I’ve replied that I’d have to see how things are once she is here. This is continuing as she remains in Hospital.</p>

<p>I’m fully prepared for all my once existent free time to disappear in a puff of smoke. It’s certainly made me reevaluate many of the things I’ve been doing. Many of them just don’t see important in the grand scheme of things now, others seem more fun. It’s a big part of my change in writing and embracing micro.blog further as well as enjoying drawing and analogue tools more.</p>

<p>Regardless, my plans don’t focus that much on me anymore. I’ll be adapting to her needs and wants.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to learn more about her and what she’s interested in.</p>

  <li>Tolkien</li>
  <li>Languages</li>
  <li>notebooks
I found it fascinating his work to include changes between dialects overtime. I’ve read a bit on the languages in Tolkein’s world and the influences of real world languages on Elvish (particularly Welsh on Sindarin) but I hadn’t paid attention to the evolution of these languages.</li>

        <h2><a href="/2018/08/21/can-you-draw.html">Can you draw a face with just vertical lines? 🤔 ✏️</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Yesterday evening I suddenly had a random idea*, <em>could I draw a face with just vertical lines?</em> I grabbed my iPad and Apple pencil and gave it a go to find out that I could indeed draw a face with just verticals lines.</p>

<p>I tried a few combinations and the decided I had gone as far as I could do I’d try horizontal lines to see the difference. I started drawing and again reached the end after about five variations. I was about to call it quits with a warm glow on my face when I suddenly realised. <em>“Vertical lines can be hair!”</em></p>

<p>Suddenly a whole host of new options were open to me as hair, then beards and more facial hair became a possibility. Then I realised ears could be shown with vertical lines and even piercings. I had given up to easily and almost missed out on a whole world of extra possibilities by not spending more time thinking and experimenting.</p>

<p>Obviously drawing a face with just vertical lines isn’t exactly a revolution or really something any of us will need to do on a day to day basis but it was fun and the main lesson —to not give up easily and keep exploring an idea — is very useful for everyday life.</p>

<p>*I believe this idea was a synthesis of practicing faces based of Activities from <a href="https://micro.blog/Rohdesign">@Rohdesign</a> and <a href="http://austinkleon.com">Austin Kleon</a></p>

        <h2><a href="/2018/08/18/a-commonplace-bookblog.html">A Commonplace (book/blog)</a></h2>
      </header>
      <section class="post-body">
        <p>Have you ever stumbled upon an idea that moved you into action? This last week I did in a minor way after listening to an episode of the sketchnote army podcast with Austin Kleon. In that episode he mentioned the way he was using his notebooks and within a day, I had picked up a new notebook to experiment. Perhaps this idea will inspire you into action as well. Or maybe not.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-commonplace-book">Creating a commonplace book</h2>
<p>Austin shared how he had started carrying a pocket notebook and logging various elements during the day. Later he’d go back over those pages and highlight the key items and ideas. Eventually, they might turn into a blog post or a book.
I had heard him talk about similar notebooking techniques before when he called it a <strong>commonplace book.</strong> This inspired me to go out, buy a <em>new</em> a6-ish size moleskine and record. I had already been doing something similar at my work desk on pages of A4, but the pocket book had the advantage of being with me not only at my desk but also on the train, when in bed and basically everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>There’s something charming about keeping an analogue notebook in an increasingly digital world.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://chrisjwilson.me/uploads/2018/4f2175887b.jpg" alt="commonplace book quote" /></p>

<h2 id="the-digital-commonplace">the digital commonplace</h2>
<p>Of course, the natural extension of this new notebook was to start sharing some extracts online, specifically on micro.blog. It reminded me of the charm of early blogging. When it wasn’t so serious, when you didn’t need a specific goal or career from it and mistakes were useful and a sign of growth. You didn’t (and don’t) have to present yourself as an expert in something you just started out in.</p>

<p>This digital commonplace book or <em>adversersia</em> had some obvious advantages such as linking to music or videos online as well as sharing items. <strong>Even though analogue tools have a charm, digital tools provide some extra functions</strong>. Of course, we don’t have to choose one or another, we can have both.</p>

<p><img src="https://tenor.com/view/why-not-both-both-yay-celebrate-two-gif-5620885" alt="por que no los dos" /></p>

<h2 id="the-need-to-dig-deeper">The need to dig deeper</h2>
<p>Keeping this notebook has made me really appreciate deeper content and devalue shallow, entertainment focused items. I want to be clear here, I’m not saying entertainment is wrong, I’m not saying you should do or feel the same, this has been my reaction. 
When reading a book or something of greater depth, material is provided for the commonplace book. A quote here, an idea there, a beautiful graphic to copy. When the material is shallow, repeating the same talking points, then it’s much rarer for my book to see any difference. I’ve almost gamed myself to want to read more books than blogs.</p>

<p>I had actually been feeling guilty or <em>FOMO</em> about not being to keep up with all the micropodcast that have been starting up (especially with starting one myself. How can I expect people to listen to my own if I don’t listen to theirs?) but this notebook has helped me deal with that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can’t do every great things, and trying to have it all, result in having nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By trying to keep up with all these podcasts and blogs, I’m missing out on reading great books. So I’m making a commitment, to fill my adversaria, to read great books and go deeper.</p>

<p>Although I’m very much an iOS user, having the option of drafts on the Mac will be great. Of course, I’m writing this in drafts.</p>
