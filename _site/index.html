        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>Yesterday I heard someone mention that their iPhone had shut down because it had got below zero Celsius (32 something Fahrenheit apparently). As someone who lives in a country where winter is often below zero (it‚Äôs minus 7 celsius as I type), I know this pain. Generally I cope by putting my iPhone in my inner pocket so it is kept warm and relying on my apple watch or AirPods for interactions with the phone. But there‚Äôs a huge issue when it comes to taking photos. 
I love photography and have far to many camera really, but there is something fun about the iPhone camera. I‚Äôve been trying to use it more recently and play with its limits and strengths but the cold weather has put a stop to those plans. Literally. 
So today I was looking for some advice on how to shoot photos with your iPhone in winter‚Ä¶So far I haven‚Äôt found any useful advice so I have an idea that <em>just might work.</em>
## Hand Warmers
Yup, you know those little chemical hand warmers which you can ‚Äúrecharge‚Äù by heating them up again. In theory holding a small one next to the back of the iPhone while I have it out of my pocket should help to keep it warm <em>and</em> should also help when it‚Äôs in my pocket. 
Of course, other sides will be exposed to the elements but this is better than nothing. </p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to give it a go and report back on my success/not but I wonder <strong>Do you have any tips for keeping your iPhone alive in the cold?</strong></p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I saw someone dismissing the possibility of verso taking Facebook on. They pointed out the failure of 
- app.net 
- Ello
- peach 
- and mastodon </p>

<p>While there‚Äôs validity in pointing out these failures. It‚Äôs not the full story. In fact there are three other networks that would be better to discuss. 
- WhatsApp 
- instagram 
- snapchat </p>

<p>Two of which Facebook bought to avoid being surpassed by (and instagram looks like the best deal they did) and one, snapchat, they have tried to kill by adding its core features to other apps. It‚Äôs important to note the difference between the apps mentioned first and these examples. Clearly Facebook precieved these apps to be a potential threat, where they didn‚Äôt view the others as threats. </p>

<p>The common thread with most of these services is that they rise when Facebook is facing difficulties. These have been privacy issues (ello) and dramatic changes in design (I.e. the newsfeed). These alternatives offer more privacy and a more familiar look. But verso isn‚Äôt in that same category, it actually fits the type of situation of instagram and snap. That is a mobile first app with some unique touches and interactions. 
This is where Facebook has always been worse and instagram is currently facing criticism for its changes to a curated newsfeed not in chronological order and full of ads. Verso offers an alternative to that. </p>

<p>Now this doesn‚Äôt mean Facebook is done and so far Facebook has done a good job at reacting to challenges, but if they try and replicate the snapchat reaction, they could confuse their interface more which is part of there current issues that have helped this challenger rise. </p>

<p>So I don‚Äôt think verso should be instantly dismissed or instantly thought of as a success. It will be interesting to watch. </p>

         	<p>So I‚Äôve seen someone write and share an article that is surprisingly similar to one I wrote and only a day later. Mine was an ‚Äúevergreen‚Äù topic but admittedly one that others have written about before. Chances are that this is just one of those strange coninsidences where <strong>actually</strong> we‚Äôre both being influenced by the same environment and so are getting the same sources of inspiration leading to similar/the same topic‚Ä¶But even as I write this, I realise this is actually the second time in just over a week.

<p>Ben‚Äôs completely right here. It‚Äôs a pain in Apple Music to go searching for certain music. The fact that singles get mixed in with Albums in a pain in the neck.</p>

         	<p>One of the things I‚Äôve found really strange on the internet are the sort of ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù schemes. You know, the internet marketer, who teaches you internet marketing, so you too can become an internet marketer, in internet marketing. Or the writer, who writes books, on how to write books‚Ä¶about writing books. Or the YouTuber who makes YouTube videos about how you can make YouTube videos. Obviously not everyone who does internet marketing or teachers internet marketing <em>only</em> does internet marketing or <em>only</em> has experience in this field, but there are plenty of other ‚Äúfake it till you make it‚Äù folk, and it‚Äôs telling when they seem to produce people who do the exact same thing (just less successfully). 
I‚Äôll add, that It‚Äôs also why I find the sketchnote community concerning sometimes. Some people only seem to share sketchnotes of how to sketchnote‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs pretty weird. </p>

         	<p>So after this week <a href="https://www.relay.fm/mpu/417">Mac Power users podcast</a> I finally got round to signing up for Micro.Blog. I had been meaning to do so for a bit, especially after seeing people like <a href="http://decoding.io/">Zsolt Benke at decoding</a> using the service on their own site. However I wondered if I should use it on my own site or whatever. In the end, I signed up for a Micro.blog blog as I wanted to help support the service as well. Paying $5 seems like a good way to do so and solved my overthinking. </p>

<p>So why did I sign up in the first place. </p>

<h2 id="my-increasing-announance-at-social-media-twitter">My increasing announance at Social Media (twitter)</h2>
<p>I‚Äôve increasingly felt that social media is very ‚Äúmeh‚Äù. I hate what Facebook has become as it increasingly tried to grab my attention with cheap tricks and tracks everything I do (no matter if I try to stop that). Twitter too isn‚Äôt perfect with its lack of efforts to stop trolling and abuse. </p>

<h2 id="my-announance-at-blogging">My announance at blogging</h2>
<p>Likewise I‚Äôm fed up of the ‚Äúprofessional blogging culture‚Äù. There are so many ‚Äúhave tos‚Äù with blogging now like:<br />
- write long posts
- have links
- be helpful
- only show the good sides
- no link posts
- be on a single focus topic
And so on and so on. 
All great advice if you want to make money, but as <a href="https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/welcome-back-blogging">CJ Chilvers says</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äúone is a business model, one is a life model‚Äù </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm hoping for in this site. Somewhere to play, somewhere to create and somewhere to be unprofessional. </p>
